# Design Principles

TODO

:   This document is a loosely organized collection of notes related to developing Design Principles
    for applying Animistic Agency within Information Technologies.

## Representing Identity

- A subjective context's available identities form a single lattice, who's bottom is defined by the
  subjective context definition itself
- a single endpoint likely represents multiple identities, some of which are coherent, and may be
  active at the same time, some of which are incoherent (todo wording?), which cannot/should not be
  active at the same time.
- When communicating, a primary identity should be in focus for all parties, this identity is the
  primary representative of the interaction. All identities below the focused identity (Down to the
  lattice bottom) are also active in secondary roles.
- Objective identities (physical phenomena) form a lattice below the subjective context node
- Whenever possible, sources of agency should speak in the first person, or use a conversational,
  intimate interface in order to emphasize their subjectivity and separate themselves from simple
  objects.

## Data and Identity

- Writing data implies ownership, which implies changing state within one or more identities within
  the subjective context
- Reading implies either ownership, or relationship

## Communication

- All actions are communication, and all communication is an action

- Any identity above, or below the agent performing the action can 'hear' the action.

    - An agent may not be aware of with whom they are communicating
    - An agent may not be aware of everything they are communicating with their actions

- interfaces should help clarify with whom the active agent (may be) communicating, and whether they
  are internal, peer, or foreign agents

- interfaces should help clarify what the active agent may be communicating with their action

## Status

- actions should be logged
- action logs should be attribute to the agent which executed, as well as agent which designed the
  action
- action logs should be timestamped and sortable
- action logs should be transformable into a narrative, story, or visualization

## Errors

- errors should be logged and part of status

## Pronouns

It's probably a good idea to form some language guidelines on how to refer to agents and the role
they are taking (are you referring to someone within the context of their free agency, within the
context of a sub-agent role they embody?, as a representative of an entire super-agency?).

## Assumptions

Our grounding principle is that the definition of who *we* are is nebulous and open to
interpretation. This is our principle affordance towards the expansiveness of [Our
Objective][]. *We* is always a *heterogeneous* collective. As such, we must be very careful about
generalizing from the particular to the general or vice versa. In order to make headway, we must
recognize that the means, methods, and mechanisms for finding our way are first and foremost
beholden to each particular contextual relationship. Any proposed solution is only effective in it's
capacity to afford meaning within any particular person's particular experience and particular
environment.

[Grounding Principle]: #grounding-principle
[Grounding Principle]{#grounding-principle}
:   To be effective, an interface between environment and cognition must fit-within as
    well as encompass the particulars of each environment and experience.

Even though the grounding principle is almost tautological, it is still must be explicit. We must
find a way that fits within and encompasses our living experience and our dynamic environment. The
way lets us understand and inhabit our agency in a manner that both encourages wise and holistic
modes of being while also expanding our agency and our potential for positive change. To be
expansive in nature, it must be adaptable to our current context. It must also be dynamic enough to
adapt to who we may become.

Our way must avoid assumptions relating to experience and environment whenever
possible. Nevertheless, assumptions must be made in order to make progress. There is no universal
way. We are aware of the following foundational assumptions within our proposed interface.

[Social Cognition Assumption]: #social-cognition-assumption
[Social Cognition Assumption]{#social-cognition-assumption}
:   We are social creatures and therefore activities of cognition such as learning and problem
    solving are best formulated within social contexts.

[Translucent Association Assumption]: #translucent-association-assumption
[Translucent Association Assumption]{#translucent-association-assumption}

:   We are associative creatures, yet our means of association is largely transparent to us. To
    cultivate wise and meaningful agency we must be able to train our very means of association. Our
    mediums of association must become transparent or opaque depending on context. Transparent so
    we can associate more skillfully, opaque so that we can better learn to associate through more
    complete understanding of the underlying medium.

[Physical Monism Assumption]: #physical-monism-assumption
[Physical Monism Assumption]{#physical-monism-assumption}
:   We will only rely on means, mechanisms, and methods that can be reliably sensed and perceived
    through objective and repeatable methods. As such, our framework will be based on a physical
    monism worldview. Nevertheless, we believe practitioners are able to successfully import their
    own metaphysical assumptions within the interface.

We have reviewed the existential question, our objective, and the constraints we must meet in order
to reach our objective. We believe we have discovered means of meeting our objective, which we call
*The Animist Interface*. The Animist Interface is based on the belief that intervention with the
greatest leverage for orienting towards deeper meaning is to ground our default cognitive framework
in inter-subjective relationship. We believe this affords the greatest potential for right-thinking
and right-action by changing our [salience landscape][], optimizing it within to the constraints of
our biology and culture to resonate with [normative harmony][]. We end our introduction with a
mission statement, which we believe encapsulates the purpose and direction of our endeavor:


[Mission Statement]: #mission-statement
[Mission Statement]{#mission-statement}
:   Provide social, psychological, and material technology which helps to unlock access to
    meaningful modes of being through embodiment of an ever-evolving landscape of living symbology
    into normative harmony.

We conclude with one final commitment: to follow our principles. The Animist Interface is itself
symbolic, and for it to be effective it must become a living symbol itself. The Interface lives
through adoption of its principles by other symbolic entities, and such entities are constitutive of
its governance base. The [Subjective Boundary][] of the Animist Interface extends to each entity
which adopts its principles. Our [Mission Statement][] guides us in preserving and protecting that
manifold.


[Principle of Self Appropriation]: #self-appropriation
[Principle of Self Appropriation]{#self-appropriation}
:   The Animist Interface will enact the principles, properties, and procedures laid out in the
    Animist Interface for its communication, coordination, and governance.
