abstract: |

  Here we introduce Buildonomy, an organization dedicated to showing a better way of organizing
  collective projects. Our protocol and design principles are able to simultaneously preserve more
  individual autonomy and create more productive organizations than standard tools and
  organizational structures provide. Fundamentally, our approach relies on closely examining the
  underlying ontological assumptions within our organizational and technological user interfaces and
  removing excessive subject-object assumptions, then replacing them with inter-subjective user
  interfaces.

  Within this collection, we lay out an expansive series of introductory essays in order to circle
  the problem space. Each one can be read on their own. We derive a set of top-level requirements
  from this material which we use to constrain the design of a protocol for coordinating acts of
  agency amongst a pluralistic collective. The consequence of the protocol is that each agent
  extends their perception such that they have greater awareness of how their actions may affect
  their individual or collective intentions, and likewise bring awareness of how their peers actions
  also contribute-to or disrupt multiple agential intentions. After defining the protocol, we end
  with a collection of essays on how it may be depoloyed and imagine what effects it may have if
  deployed successfully.
