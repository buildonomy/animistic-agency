# About the Project

As stated in the introduction, the purpose of this project is optimize how we all relate to our own
contextual environments in a manner that extends and improves personal agency AND enables better
coordination. We hope to create a solid foundation of core metaphysical principles rooted in
subjective truth, and then extend and apply those principles into our shared environment through
developing application, theory, stories, and guidelines on how social and physical technology can
and should be optimized to interact with our innately subjective reality. By re-contextualizing our
increasingly abstract and symbolic world into a language of social and embodied cognition,
technology can work with, and not against, the specific strengths and weaknesses of the self-aware
mind.
