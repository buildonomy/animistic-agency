[Agent]{#agent}

:   An entity exhibiting [Agency][].


[Aggregate Agent]: #aggregate-agent
[Aggregate Agent]{#aggregate-agent}

:   An agent who's subjective environment consists of the relationships between a set of agents. The
    agents sense-data, attention, values, intentions, and actions are a function of the relationships
    between these sub-agents.


[Animism]: #animism
[Animist]: #animism
[Animism]{#animism}

:   From Animism [@ANIMISM]:

    > Animism (from Latin: anima, 'breath, spirit, life') is the belief that objects, places, and
    > creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. Potentially, animism perceives all
    > things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork, and perhaps even
    > words—as animated and alive. ... [Animism places] focus on knowing how to behave toward other
    > beings, some of whom are not human.


[Autopoiesis]: #autopoiesis
[Autopoietic]: #autopoiesis
[Autopoiesis]{#autopoiesis}

:   The capacity to maintain [agency][] in the face of environmental perturbations and other
    personal insults. See [The Cognitive Limits of Embodied Being][].


[Cognitive Scope]: #cognitive-scope
[CS]: #cognitive-scope
[Cognitive Scope]{#cognitive-scope}

:   As proposed in (@relevance-realization) and summarized in the following excerpt from
    (@normativity):

    > The first variable, *cognitive scope* (CS), involves competition between special-purpose and
    > general-purpose learning strategies.  Special-purpose learning strategies are metabolically
    > costly for a cognitive system since they process information in a particular domain with high
    > rigor (with the possibility of finding high reward). Such strategies risk loss to the
    > cognitive system since they are costly and their domain may not yield sufficient reward to
    > break even. On the contrary, general-purpose learning strategies are metabolically cheap for a
    > cognitive system since they process information across several domains with low
    > rigor. However, such strategies risk high opportunity cost for the cognitive by forfeiting the
    > rigorous examination of domains that do yield high rewards (this is the risk that
    > special-purpose learning strategies mitigate). Accordingly, "CS tracks [the system's
    > applicability to its environment when] the cognitive organism is continually redesigning
    > itself as some trade-off between a general-purpose and special-purpose machine” (p. 14).

[Cognitive Tempering]: #cognitive-tempering
[CT]: #cognitive-tempering
[Cognitive Tempering]{#cognitive-tempering}

:   As proposed in (@relevance-realization) and summarized in the following excerpt from
    (@normativity):

    > The second variable they identify is *cognitive tempering* (CT), which involves competition
    > between exploitative and explorative learning strategies. Exploitative learning strategies aim
    > to acquire the possible benefits of an opportunity that can be easily and immediately
    > accessed. However, such strategies risk missing potentially greater opportunities
    > elsewhere. Conversely, explorative learning strategies aim to mitigate this risk by acquiring
    > the possible benefits of uncertain opportunities that can only be accessed through the cost of
    > a search (if at all). Of course, such strategies risk losing out on easily and immediately
    > accessible opportunities at a high cost (the risk that exploitative strategies mitigate). An
    > optimization of CT through a self-organized "internal processing of the opposition between
    > inhibition of return and reinforcement of return" may therefore allow the system to "find an
    > intelligent way to trade-off exploitation with exploration" (p. 15).


[Cognitive Prioritization]: #cognitive-prioritization
[CP]: #cognitive-prioritization
[Cognitive Prioritization]{#cognitive-prioritization}

:   As proposed in (@relevance-realization) and summarized in the following excerpt from
    (@normativity):

    > The final internal economic property that Vervaeke et al. (2012) identify is *cognitive
    > prioritization* (CP). Unlike both CS and CT, CP concerns "the structure and prioritization of
    > [various] cost functions" rather than with "how [individual] cost functions might be
    > heuristically optimized" (p. 15). CP is achieved through the interaction of several competing
    > cost functions, each of which is an internal metric that tracks progress in its respective
    > problem domain (e.g., finding food in the environment, avoiding predators in the environment,
    > etc.). When low positive feedback is received in one domain (i.e., low energy reserves), the
    > system's resources become more focused on solving that particular problem (i.e., finding
    > food). Once the issue has been resolved, though, the system's resources become less focused on
    > that one problem, and become more diversified instead. Cognitive prioritization is this
    > process of "flexibly gambling" one's resources amongst various concurrent problems (p. 16).

[Dialogos]: #dialogos
[Dialogos]{#dialogos}

:   The following quotes are from "Dialectic into Dialogos and the Pragmatics of No-thingness in a
    Time of Crisis." (@dialogos)

    > The [psychotechnology][] of dialectic is a practice of discernment that discloses the
    > affective difference between valences of [no-thingness][] while integrating their
    > aspects. Dialectic cultivates perspectival stereoscopy, a form of contradictory self-identity
    > that functions as an [opponent process][] that resolves into an implicit singleness and depth
    > of being that the Buddhists called shunyata, or "no-thingness."

    later:

    > In dialogos, the intersubjective exchange of perspectives conditions the emergence of a third
    > presence. In previous work, we have referred to this presence as a Geist, though others have
    > called it a third factor or "we space." This Geist becomes the persona of the numinosity of
    > the encounter. This was among the seminal insights of Martin Buber's I-Thou relation: "When
    > one says you, the I of the word pair I-You is said, too... The basic I-You can only be spoken
    > with one's whole being... Whoever speaks one of the basic words enters into the word and
    > stands in it." Dialogos self-organizes a spiritual pilotry that uses both integration and
    > differentiation to steer the streams of movement between being and non-being.

    and then:

    > The dialectic cultivated within dialogos uses the internalization of otherness in I-Thou
    > relating to effect the transmutation of autobiographical narrative into this ontological
    > retraction. In this stereoscopic mergence of egoic identity with the internalization of an
    > adopted perspective, the prospective view from "you" is fused with the intimate view from "I,"
    > like the left and right fields of vision. This mergence affords what we may call ontological
    > depth perception

    also:

    > In dialogos, this amounts to the following changes in conversational convention:
    >
    > 1) We begin to speak with our silence; we bespeak the possibility afforded by the
    >    co-internalization of perspectives, which means we think into (recall the epistolary
    >    metaphor) the perspectival stereopsis that is still forming and transforming with our
    >    participation.
    >
    > 2) We begin to listen with our speech; language provides necessity to frame our thinking and
    >    constrain its possibility, even as it sources from it. The communing silence is realized
    >    against the obsidian of the spoken word, like waves lapping on the rocks. Yet the silence,
    >    not the speech, is the no-thing that is lapping.


[The Frame Problem]: #frame-problem
[Frame Problem]: #frame-problem
[Frame Problem]{#frame-problem}

:   As summarized in (@normativity) via the excerpt below, the frame problem lies at the heart of
    what makes it difficult to act with meaning in the world. The difficulty lies not so much with
    what one knows, but with what one actively ignores. The universe is open-ended, there are
    infinite ways of slicing our 'reality field' into discrete concepts and there are
    combinatorially explosive ways each of those concepts could interact. The frame problem
    introduces us to this issue in further detail.

    > To begin, we must consider that the ability to realize relevance either requires or counts as
    > implicit or explicit information processing. This leads to a significant challenge for any
    > would-be cognitive system: since they only have finite resources, these systems need a finite
    > means of ignoring an infinite set of information and selecting a finite set of information for
    > processing without compromising their ability to be normatively coupled. This is a version of
    > the notorious frame problem. Any solution to the frame problem is said to "realize
    > relevance".
    >
    > ...
    >
    > Historically, relevance realization has tended to resist naturalization due mostly to two
    > pervasive theoretical challenges. Addressing these challenges may help to bring us closer to a
    > scientific theory of how cognitive systems realize relevance. The first challenge is that an
    > acceptable theory of relevance realization is required to explain how cognition realizes
    > relevance without presupposing relevance realization: it must refrain from committing the
    > [homuncular fallacy][].
    >
    > ...
    >
    > The second challenge is that a theory of relevance realization must neither implicitly nor
    > explicitly utilize a substantive (or fixed) definition of relevance, since "there is no stable,
    > homogeneous class of entities which correspond to the term 'relevance'"
    > (@relevance-realization). A theory of relevance realization should instead involve a procedure
    > that yields a context-sensitive set of entities, which, when the procedure occurs correctly, count
    > as relevant.

    See also @frame-problem, which summarizes the frame problem as follows:

    > The epistemological problem is this: How is it possible for holistic, open-ended,
    > context-sensitive relevance to be captured by a set of propositional, language-like
    > representations of the sort used in classical AI? The computational counterpart to the
    > epistemological problem is this. How could an inference process tractably be confined to just
    > what is relevant, given that relevance is holistic, open-ended, and context-sensitive?

    In this text, we refer to the epistemological frame problem and its computational counterpart,
    not the more limited technical frame problem from logic-based artificial intelligence research.


[Homuncular Fallacy]: #homuncular-fallacy
[Homuncular]: #homuncular-fallacy
[Homuncular Fallacy]{#homuncular-fallacy}

:   Prescribing the solution to a difficult concept in terms of the concept itself in a recursive
    manner. For example how does one see? well we have a part of our brain that sees and sends us
    the information about what it sees. It is a fallacy because that provides no explanatory
    power. How does that portion of our brain see? Does it contain a sub-portion that sees?


[imaginal]: #imaginal
[Imaginal Realm]: #imaginal
[mundus imaginalis]: #imaginal
[Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd]: #imaginal
[Imaginal (Mundus Imaginalis)]{#imaginal}

:   The term imaginal was first introduced to modern discourse by the philosopher Henry Corbin in
    1964 in the paper *Mundus imaginalis ou l'imaginaire et l'imaginal*, or in English *Mundus
    Imaginalis or the Imaginary and the Imaginal*. As he explains in the introduction:

    > I was absolutely obliged to find another term [than imaginary] because, for many years, I have
    > been by vocation and profession an interpreter of Arabic and Persian texts, the purposes of
    > which I would certainly have betrayed if I had been entirely and simply content-even with
    > every possible precaution-with the term imaginary.

    We believe the following quote best summarizes the Imaginal realm and its contents. The quoted
    translation is available from https://amiscorbin.com/en/, the citation is in the bibliography
    (@corbin1964mundus).

    > There is our physical sensory world, which includes both our earthly world (governed by human
    > souls) and the sidereal universe (governed by the Souls of the Spheres); this is the sensory
    > world, the world of phenomena (*molk*). There is the suprasensory world of the Soul or
    > Angel-Souls, the *Malakut*, in which there are the mystical cities that we have just named,
    > and which begins "on the convex surface of the Ninth Sphere." There is the universe of pure
    > archangelic Intelligences. To these three universes correspond three organs of knowledge: the
    > senses, the imagination, and the intellect, a triad to which corresponds the triad of
    > anthropology: body, soul, spirit-a triad that regulates the triple growth of man, extending
    > from this world to the resurrections in the other worlds.
    >
    > We observe immediately that we are no longer reduced to the dilemma of thought and extension,
    > to the schema of a cosmology and a gnoseology limited to the empirical world and the world of
    > abstract understanding. Between the two is placed an intermediate world, which our authors
    > designate as *'alam al-mithal*, the world of the Image, *mundus imaginalis*: a world as
    > ontologically real as the world of the senses and the world of the intellect, a world that
    > requires a faculty of perception belonging to it, a faculty that is a cognitive function, a
    > *noetic* value, as fully real as the faculties of sensory perception or intellectual
    > intuition. This faculty is the imaginative power, the one we must avoid confusing with the
    > imagination that modern man identifies with "fantasy" and that, according to him, produces
    > only the "imaginary." Here we are, then, simultaneously at the heart of our research and of
    > our problem of terminology.
    >
    > What is that intermediate universe? It is the one we mentioned a little while ago as being
    > called the "eighth climate."8 For all of our thinkers, in fact, the world of extension
    > perceptible to the senses includes the *seven climates* of their traditional geography. But
    > there is still another climate, represented by that world which, however, possesses extension
    > and dimensions, forms and colors, without their being perceptible to the senses, as they are
    > when they are properties of physical bodies. No, these dimensions, shapes, and colors are the
    > proper object of imaginative perception or the "psychospiritual senses"; and that world,
    > fully objective and real, where everything existing in the sensory world has its analogue, but
    > not perceptible by the senses, is the world that is designated as the *eighth climate*. The
    > term is sufficiently eloquent by itself, since it signifies a climate *outside* of climates, a
    > place *outside* of place, outside of *where* (*Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd*!).


[Infinite Game]: #infinite-game
[Infinite Game]{#infinite-game}

:   Finite games are the familiar contests of everyday life; they are played in order to be won,
    which is when they end. But infinite games are more mysterious. Their object is not winning, but
    ensuring the continuation of play. The rules may change, the boundaries may change, even the
    participants may change --- as long as the game is never allowed to come to an end. (@FIG)

    > There are at least two kinds of games, one could be called finite; the other infinite. A finite
    > game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the
    > play.


[Intra-Subjective Relationship]: #intra-subjective-agent
[Intra-Subjective Relationship]{#intra-subjective-agent}

:   The relationship between a sub-agent and a super-agent, where the sub-agent is embodied within
    the contextual-environment of the super-agent.


[Inter-Subjective Relationship]: #inter-subjective-relationship
[Inter-Subjective Relationship]{#inter-subjective-relationship}

:   A relationship between two agents, who are both embodied within the same external contextual
    environment but share no subjectivity with one another.


[metaphysical]: #metaphysics
[metaphysics]: #metaphysics
[Metaphysics]{#metaphysics}

:   As quoted from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (@metaphysics):

    > It is not easy to say what metaphysics is. Ancient and Medieval philosophers might have said
    > that metaphysics was, like chemistry or astrology, to be defined by its subject-matter:
    > metaphysics was the "science" that studied "being as such" or "the first causes of things" or
    > "things that do not change". It is no longer possible to define metaphysics that way, for two
    > reasons. First, a philosopher who denied the existence of those things that had once been seen
    > as constituting the subject-matter of metaphysics---first causes or unchanging things---would
    > now be considered to be making thereby a metaphysical assertion. Second, there are many
    > philosophical problems that are now considered to be metaphysical problems (or at least partly
    > metaphysical problems) that are in no way related to first causes or unchanging things---the
    > problem of free will, for example, or the problem of the mental and the physical.

    A sister document to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the homepage of [The Metaphysics
    Research Lab](https://mally.stanford.edu/) describes metaphysics in its relation to physics:

    > Whereas physics is the attempt to discover the laws that govern fundamental concrete objects,
    > metaphysics is the attempt to discover the laws that systematize the fundamental abstract
    > objects presupposed by physical science, such as mathematical objects and relations, possible
    > states and events, types (as opposed to tokens), possible and future objects, complex
    > properties, etc. Abstract objects are even needed to understand what may turn out to be
    > scientific fictions (e.g., causality, models) as well as clearcut cases of scientific fictions
    > (e.g., absolute simultaneity, the aether, and phlogiston). The goal of metaphysics, therefore,
    > is to develop a formal ontology, i.e., a formally precise systematization of these abstract
    > objects. Such a theory will be compatible with the world view of natural science if the
    > abstract objects postulated by the theory are conceived as patterns of the natural world.

    As described within [What We Know Is Grounded in What We Are][], the fundamental supposition
    that grounds this treatise's metaphysics is subjective awareness of being embedded in a larger
    cosmos. As such, it is inherently incomplete, and is only applicable to creatures conscious of
    their own conditional existence. This is in contrast with most metaphysics, which attempts to
    carve reality at its joints in a manner that transcends our own awareness of reality.

[no-thingness]: #no-thingness
[no-thingness]{#no-thingness}

:   The following definition is from "Dialectic into Dialogos and the Pragmatics of No-thingness in
    a Time of Crisis" (@dialogos):

    > Throughout this paper, we will use "nothingness" to denote the referent of the privative,
    > nihilistic experience, and "no-thingness" to denote the referent of the superlative experience
    > realized in self-transcendence.


[ontology]: #ontology
[Ontology]{#ontology}

:   Personal Ontology, as opposed to Ontological Philosophy, is the rich map of information that is
    intrinsic to the understanding and embodiment of being. Concepts are born from it, but much of
    it is pre-conceptual and sub-conscious.

    Ontological philosophy is the philosophy of being and questioning of what it is to exist.
    Ontology is similar but different from epistemology, which is the philosophy of knowledge---how
    do we know what we know is true?

[opponent processing]: #opponent-process

[opponent processes]: #opponent-process
[Opponent Process]{#opponent-process}

:   The following definition is from "Dialectic into Dialogos and the Pragmatics of No-thingness in
    a Time of Crisis" (@dialogos):

    > Opponent processing is a dynamic means of controlling a process by binding two functions that
    > work for opposing goals, but are nevertheless causally interdependent. A biological example is
    > the autonomic nervous system, divided into the sympathetic (which is trying to raise the level
    > of arousal) and the parasympathetic nervous system (which is trying to reduce the level of
    > metabolic arousal).  Their opponent process continually recalibrates and works to balance the
    > individual's level of arousal.

[psychotechnology]: #psychotechnology
[psychotechnology]{#psychotechnology}

:   The following definition is from "Dialectic into Dialogos and the Pragmatics of No-thingness in
    a Time of Crisis" (@dialogos):

    > The term "psychotechnology" refers to a socially generated standardization of formatting
    > communication and application of information processing that can be readily and deeply
    > internalized by individuals. Psychotechnologies are readily and widely disseminated through
    > a population in order to reliably and systematically enhanced cognitive performance in a

    > to fit and enhance the mind.


[Reciprocal Narrowing]: #reciprocal-narrowing
[Reciprocal Narrowing]{#reciprocal-narrowing}

:   When an agent:arena relationship shrinks with respect to quality and/or quantity in a mutually
    reinforcing manner, the [transjective][] system is in a process of reciprocal narrowing. This
    is most commonly associated with addiction.


[Regular Language]: #regular-language
[Regular Language]{#regular-language}

:   Per the wikipedia entry on [Regular
    Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_language&oldid=1151967916)

    > In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular language (also called a
    > rational language)is a formal language that can be defined by a regular expression, in the
    > strict sense in theoretical computer science (as opposed to many modern regular expression
    > engines, which are augmented with features that allow the recognition of non-regular
    > languages).
    >
    > Alternatively, a regular language can be defined as a language recognized by a finite
    > automaton. The equivalence of regular expressions and finite automata is known as Kleene's
    > theorem (after American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene). In the Chomsky hierarchy,
    > regular languages are the languages generated by Type-3 grammars.

[Relevance Realization]{#relevance-realization}

:   The following description is excerpted from (@normativity). \

    > We believe that Vervaeke et al. (2012) offer the best explanation that is currently available
    > in the literature.  They argue that relevance realization in cognition involves
    > "inter-related" modes of sub-representational "[opponent processing][]" in cognition. Let us
    > unpack this claim, beginning with opponent processing. Opponent processing involves two
