# Animistic Agency

*An Exploration into the Phenomenology of Agency*

Welcome! This is a work in progress, but we really hope you take a look. We believe this idea of
Animistic Agency is important but need your help to figure it out. If you want to get a flavor of
what we're trying to do, start by reading [The Introduction](01_introduction.md), and/or [About The
Project](90_about_the_project.md).

## Abstract

Here we introduce the General Theory of Animistic Agency to represent embedded cognitive
agents. Animistic Agency constructs an identity between objective statements and evaluative
statements, thereby strengthening inferences related to intentions, and refuting the [isâ€“ought
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem) (i.e. Hume's law). This formalism
has plausible applications for cognitive science and philosophy, artificial general intelligence
alignment, and for the analysis and design of incentive structures within multi-agent organizations,
such as corporations, governments and markets.
