# A Roadmap Towards Legibly Inferring Intentions

Where I've been

* about_me and Inferring_Intentions

* Companies are anti social. They develop psychosis on understanding who and what they are due to
  the brittleness of their structure and inability to recursively realize relevance. Their nature is
  structurally optimized for exploitation and specialization.

  * Relevance Realization, learning, differentiation

    * Every asset is a liability

      * The kludginess of automation: brittle, requires bespoke mini-languages and knowing a deep stack
      * the language barriers of software: off the shelf products are trying to build a moat, so
        either support a "third party ecosystem", or just re-build every feature. Each UI is bespoke,
        and therefore to use software you have to know a mini-language. If you want to customize it
        to form to your purpose, often you are SOL either because that's not an option or you need to
        hire a team just to act as the gatekeepers to your now even-more fragile creation.
      * all capex (including software) ages, requires maintenance, goes out of date. Requires
        revisiting trade-studies to even know if each product is "correct"
      * which feeds into:

    * the effort required to keep everyone on the same page. What is relevant for each differentiated
      part or role.

      * Hire people to keep people on the same page like technical writing teams or systems engineers
        and then your org structure becomes more specialized, which has an adverse effect on keeping a
        company from having the same mission, as internal specializations become more exacting and org
        structures become more stove-piped.
      * the opaqueness of documentation. Even if you are consistent about keeping documentation up to
        date, the problem of knowing what each employee should know and should read is ill defined.
      * Why can't each asset be an opportunity (enhance generalization and exploration)
      * As a piece of the company, it is easier to write more than it is to delete or remove, as
        everything produced might still have value, and its very difficult to know what is _actually_
        relevant unless one is aware of the entire state of being of the company. This means
        that the artifacts of complexity and calcification naturally accrue.

  * Ego

    * Companies take themselves too seriously

      * No one dies if a company fails. Companies are walking around in a dark forest of their own
        imaginations. It should be much easier for company capex and intellectual assets to feed the
        ecosystem if they don't make it then is currently the case. Unfortunately the 'corpse' of a
        company is pretty illegible, it takes a lot of effort to compare what one company is doing
        against another in order to see the pro and cons between the approaches of each particular
        capability.
      * Companies are supposed to make people's lives better, not people make companies lives
        better. Too often priorities are flipped when companies value their survival too strongly.
      * What is relevant to a company's short term and long term success is not often legible. In the
        short term, a company must know the intentions its supply chain, customer base, as well as
        employees in order to have a handle on what to focus on. In the long term, a company must
        find, form, and evolve a niche in the ecosystem of human needs in order to identify threats,
        understand allies, and support synergies.

    * Companies don't take themselves seriously enough

      * Most improvements in quality of life require sustained attention across a long time, as well
        as an organized collection of differentiated expertise as well as low-enough stakes in order
        to finance multiple bets in the same space. A marketplace of companies is well suited to
        solving these constraints.
      * Instead of viewing companies as a jungle ecosystem, we should view them more as a
        microbiome. Characterized by a directed flow of energy (the needs and quality of life
        improvements of persons), as well as gene swapping. Companies should not be aimed at nation
        building, but healthy _local_ ecosystem building. Instead of defaulting to expansion and
        mergers when succeeding, companies should default to fractionate.
      * Companies are largely responsible for forming the ecological niche's that we operate
        within. They are the primary ecosystem builders of the mileau within which persons exist. As
        such, they shape preferences inasmuch as they find and respond to preferences.

Where I'm going



-----

Homeostatic normativity expresses something simple. To have homeostatic normativity is to have a set
of values about relationship between different categories of measurable things. It values a certain
relationship between two or more quantities. A thermostat contains a certain homeostatic normativity
between measured temperature and measured heater state. Homeostatic normativity points clearly to
simple intentions. I desire to eat because I desire nutrition and energy for my body. Similarly, I
desire to breathe because I also desire energy and expulsion of waste gas from my body.

Autopoietic normativity is the value in becoming one thing rather than an alternative option. We
have no choice but to change, so there is no option to value becoming versus being in itself. For
our world is dynamic, and change is necessary in order to be alive and act. We do possess some
choice in how we change. This is the value we place in the future. I desire children because I value
preserving this precious property of self-aware existence into the changing future. I desire to
learn because I value expanding my possible future states beyond what I can currently comprehend.

What the process of intention forming is faced with is a problem of understanding where one is and
what is both [homeostatically and autopoietically](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23054553/)
valuable. Both where one is and what is valuable are never given, but must be continuously
learned. Intention forms through the mapping between the two. Once intention forms, further
cognitive phenomena must map those intentions into procedural and participatory ways of knowing such
that higher order intentions can propagate through space and time into the objective world through
action and reaction.

"Where" one is is more complicated than pinpointing an individual on a map. It encompasses multiple
representations of their internal state as well as their relationships within the world at
large. Such states and relationships are dynamic and multi-dimensional, so knowing where one is must
involve holding and interrelating many different types of maps, placing self and other entities in
relation to one another.

In general the problem of situating oneself is a problem of dimensional expansion; taking limited
data and inferring a much greater landscape from that sparse information. When one has this
landscape, one is able to move internally within it and adjust perspective in order to develop
different perspectives on where one is currently located in the world.

On the other hand understanding normativity involves informational compression. The ability to take
highly varied, noisy streams of information and find the through line that extracts the lesson that
connects our observations to our future well being. What type of lesson can I learn? What learned
lesson should I apply?


This places constraints on how to improve our state of intention inference. Training must not
require more than we expect from, say a high school level course. Extended enhancements from
technology must be generally accessible to all regardless of class or income.

Here is a quick list of effects, both positive and negative, if we can bring a system of more
reliable intention inference that meets these constraints into the world:

- difference in scale and hierarchy of intention: sub-intentions. Want to walk up the ladder to
  express as much of the top of the stack as can be reliably inferred. This information is the most
  durable and most useful for coordination
- difference in available access to technological intention modeling: government and corporate
  surveillance for capture and control. If this capacity is personally available, it should limit
  the capture effects and
  [multipolar-traps](https://conversational-leadership.net/blog/multipolar-trap/) of our current
  informational landscape.
- socratic tutor: capacity to analyze self intention and propagate likely end-states
- double edged sword: butterfly effect of influencing intention
- constrain and coordinate with ai as it approaches AGI, if transparent intention modeling can be
  created, it should have a taming effect on the end-states of AGI, as it helps to align researchers
  and their technology awithin the greater intention landscape.
- intention models become a new lens on ecosystem analysis, as they create a higher ordered
  representation upon which to perform structural anaysis such as [Chemical Order Theory on the
  complexity/stability of ecosystem-like commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08006). This presents
  the possibility for ententional ecosystem design in order to identify gaps in stable communities
  and evolve or integrate entities that can fill the necessary niches to induce their stability.
