abstract: |

  We develop the General Theory of Animistic Agency to represent embedded cognitive
  agents. Animistic Agency provides an identity between objective statements and evaluative
  statements, thereby strengthening inferences related to intentions and refuting Hume's law. This
  formalism has plausible applications for cognitive science and philosophy, artificial general
  intelligence alignment, and for the analysis and design of incentive structures within multi-agent
  organizations such as corporations, governments and markets.
