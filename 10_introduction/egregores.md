# Egregores

## Defining Egregores

## Perceiving Egregores

Finding egregores. How do we define the markov boundary of each egregore? Where do we find
constrained maximal entropy? What dimension's of 'optionality' is that constrained maximal entropy
keeping open? What is a substrate, where does egregore come from in its dynamics.

Egregores need a substrate. Humans are unique in their capacity to simultaneously manifest multiple
egregores. Cells scaffold into single entities, birds flock together, humans are part of families,
cities, businesses, interest groups, cultures. Each is spacio-tempoarily disjoint.

## Speaking with Egregores

Why would we give an egregore a voice? To better decide if they are a friend or foe. To learn.

What would it take? Markov blanket and a dissipation function(al)s and Active Inference Engine.

What ramifications would it have? Alignment wise: Could ensure the substrate is balanced by
introducing such entities pair wise, such that there is a stable competitive dynamic between the
system's normative orders. Society wise: would it isolate people more to communicate with these
phenomena? Would it bring people closer together?
