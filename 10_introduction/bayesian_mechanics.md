# Bayesian Mechanics for Organizations


The Markov Blanket for an organization extends to where the context and model are no longer
separable. You can tell if you are 'inside' or 'outside' some collective if you can discriminate
model from configuration for some salient entity within your context. You cannot necessarily tell
what organization that is a piece of though, unless you can map either the model or configuration to
their source(s) of truth.
