# Survey of the Sanghas

Like a good engineer I end this essay abruptly and awkwardly with a list. My intention is to list
contemporary thinkers, communities, and memes that I identifies as each challenging assumptions on
the separation of objective and subjective reality. Each of these groups has insights that deserve
to be shared with one another. I hope to write about and explore each one on its own terms in later
essays, relating their lessons back to the field of systems engineering. For now, I must be content
with simply acknowledging each one, promising to turn each touch point into a full fledged dialogue
at a later time.

1. **The News Landscape**: Notionally objective presentations of current events are being
   increasingly replaced by opinion writers and organizations with a specific political
   slant. Current news consumers are both expecting and demanding their news sources to stop hiding
   their subjective preferences.
1. **Cryptocurrency and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: There's a realization that
   much of the infrastructure of modern life is not responsive or interested in having a dialogue
   with the persons that use their services. Cryptocurrency and DAOs are two phenomena where
   entrepreneurs are attempting to correct this, either by making explicitly intention-neutral
   infrastructure (cryptocurrency) or by making infrastructure that is explicitly oriented towards
   the intentions of its stakeholders (DAOs). By minimizing the power of executives, collective
   organizations are less vulnerable to being hijacked by corporate executive power who are more
   likely to use collective trust in the organization to perform anti-social actions. Prominent
   thinkers in this space include Vitalik Buterin and Glen Weyl.
1. **Intentional Community**: This is a more diffuse phenomena. There are many thinkers and
   communities who understand that the way we organize has both positive and negative effects on our
   selves and our environment. Some collectives who work intentionally in this space include: [Game
   B](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=An_Introduction_to_Game_B)
   movement. [Metamodernism](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Metamodernism), [Strong Towns](
   https://www.strongtowns.org/), [permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture), and
   [doomer optimism](https://www.doomeroptimism.com/). [Inter Cooperative
   Council](https://icc.coop/). [Skywoman/Blackbird](https://www.skywoman.community/about)
1. **Post Modern Reconceptualizations on the Nature of Progress and History**: Much of the heated
   discourse surrounding new terms like "intersectionality" and "woke" seems to revolve around a new
   sensitivity to how our institutions and collective behavior respond differently to in and out
   groups, whether explicitly designed that way or not. A few thinkers I appreciate in this space,
   who although they are not central to the cultural touch points, have reframed my relationship
   with our institutions are Howard Zinn and his "[A People's History of the United
   States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_People%27s_History_of_the_United_States)", and David
   Graeber's works, notably [Debt: The First 5000
   Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years), and [The Dawn of
   Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything). The main premise, and maybe
   this is a Post Modern insight at its heart is that records and narratives are never truly
   objective, there is always at least an element of subjectivity contained in them.
1. **A Renewed Orientation in the Power and Meaning of Symbols and Rituals**: For me, this
   phenomenon is most represented by Jonathan Pageau's work on [The Symbolic
   World](https://thesymbolicworld.com/). Although ritual and symbolism remains deeply associated
   with religion, they power of these forms is that they speak to our capacity to subjectively
   relate to reality on simultaneously through multiple subjective perspectives. Rituals and symbols
   are therefore not therefore strictly tied to religion in that they speak to the fractal nature of
   subjectivity and phenomenology itself. The power of symbolism to improve our relationship with
   reality is being rediscovered outside of the religious experience. [Scout Ranier
   Wiley](https://theoscillatorsstone.substack.com/about), and [Brendan Graham
   Dempsey](https://substack.com/@brendangrahamdempsey) are examples of metamodern practitioners
   working to re-incorporate symbols and rituals designed for our present and future reality.
1. **Health Coaching**: The is a renewed realization that the mind and body are not as separable as
   we would like to think. [Lifestyle Health
   Coaching](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125027/) are a relatively new
   phenomenon. A health coach assists clients in achieving a more healthy, full-featured
   life. Unlike traditional medicine or coaching practices they do not try and focus on a single
   facet of an individual's well-being. Instead they work with an individual to improve their
   physiological and psychological fortitude in its entirety. Essentially they improve physical
   symptoms and health measures by helping a person develop positive psychological adaptations.
1. **Psychedelic Therapy**: Psychedelics, psychoactive compounds that temporarily alter a person's
   state of consciousness, are undergoing a renaissance of sorts. The medical community is learning
   how effective they can be at treating previously untreatable conditions such as major depressive
   disorder, PTSD, and substance use disorders. What differentiates psychedelic therapy from
   traditional approaches is the degree by which subjective states are affected by an objective
   intervention. Commonly drugs are thought of as physical interventions to produce physical
   changes, such as by continuously administering drugs to change signaling pathways in the brain
   associated with the condition, whereas therapy is a psychological approach to produce
   psychological change through continuously administered therapy sessions. In psychedelic therapy a
   few or even single high intensity session that uses a drug to change the chemistry of the brain
   in a manner not directly correlated with the underlying condition can have long lasting changes
   on a person's psychological perspective, essentially rewiring the brain to make the individual
   more resilient against their previously debilitating condition.
1. **Cognitive Science**: Arguably those closest to the center of this paradoxical maelstrom are
   those studying cognitive science as well as those attempting to engineer artificial general
   intelligence. For better or for worse, they therefore have the most potential to influence the
   rest of us who are looking for a synthesis between objective and subjective reality. Erik Hoel
   wrote a whole book about how difficult this synthesis is, [The World Behind the World:
   Consciousness, Free Will, and the Limits of
   Science](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=The+World+Behind+the+World). Because of how central this
   topic is to everything buildonomy is directed at building on, we will split this topic into many
   individual sub-topics.

   1. **The Nature of Emergence**: A central question, which Erik [writes about
      academically](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1314922110) is whether emergence is a
      real phenomenon or a convenient simplification of a fundamentally reductionist
      universe. [Alicia Juararro](https://mitpress.mit.edu/author/alicia-juarrero-3467/) also wrote
      two books on this question which I hope to read soon.
   1. **The Field of Cognitive Science**: [Cognitive
      Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) as a field has evolved in
      relationship to its orientation towards this question. Cognitive Science began as a distinct
      area of study in the 1970's as an interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its
      processes; in no small part cognitive science was a direct response to the problems faced in
      the nascent field of artificial intelligence research. Through the following decades this
      field has been instrumental in framing the central problems of what it means to think. The
      multi disciplinary nature of cognitive science appeals to me, especially contemporary ideas
      and teachers in the space, such as [John Vervaeke](https://johnvervaeke.com/), the [Extended
      mind thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis), and other approaches that
      directly confront the necessity of any cognitive being to think in an embodied manner.
   1. **Artificial Intelligence Alignment Problem**: This group of researchers and ideas congregate
      at [The AI Alignment
      Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Yp2vYb4zHXEeoTkJc/welcome-and-faq), who describe
      themselves as "a single online hub for researchers to discuss all ideas related to ensuring
      that transformatively powerful AIs are aligned with human values". Due to its close
      relationship a derivative of the [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/faq#About_LessWrong)
      community, AI Alignment generally has a very rationalist flavor, and is very good at
      systematically identifying outcomes given a set of premises, but as identified by [meta
      rationality](https://metarationality.com/) is generally poor at identifying what premises are
      valid or not within various contexts. As I mention in About Me, something about the premises
      behind the community's approach to discussing and resolving alignment has felt off to me but
      they have been a central source of inspiration and motivation to integrating AI research into
      the project of buildonomy.
   1. **Active Inference**: Perhaps most exciting and congruent with the direction that buildonomy
      is heading is the theory of [Active
      Inference](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262045353/active-inference/), the [Free Energy
      Principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle), and [Bayesian
      Mechanics](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2022.0029). These ideas are
      being actively researched by [Karl Friston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_J._Friston) and
      collaborators. There's promising hints that this approach may form the basis for a new
      paradigm of artificial intelligence that avoids many of the technical and philosophical issues
      endemic to current deep learning approaches to intelligence research. [Verses
      AI](https://www.verses.ai/) is a young company founded to take these ideas out of pure
      research and into practical applications. Karl Friston serves as their Chief Scientist. I hope
      to collaborate with them, potentially as a [partner](https://www.verses.ai/partners), to
      design a new paradigm on how we can effectively navigate between the poles of individual
      genius and collective process in order to engineer effectively and creatively together.
