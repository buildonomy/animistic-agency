# Bureaucracies are Structurally Anti Social

Bureaucracies are anti social. They develop psychosis on understanding who and what they are due to the
brittleness of their structure and inability to recursively realize relevance. Their nature is
structurally optimized for exploitation and specialization. Why? Our social coordination and
expectations naturally lead to this



## Relevance Realization, learning, differentiation

* Every asset is a liability

  * The kludginess of automation: brittle, requires bespoke mini-languages and knowing a deep stack
  * the language barriers of software: off the shelf products are trying to build a moat, so
    either support a "third party ecosystem", or just re-build every feature. Each UI is bespoke,
    and therefore to use software you have to know a mini-language. If you want to customize it
    to form to your purpose, often you are SOL either because that's not an option or you need to
    hire a team just to act as the gatekeepers to your now even-more fragile creation.
  * all capex (including software) ages, requires maintenance, goes out of date. Requires
    revisiting trade-studies to even know if each product is "correct"
  * which feeds into:

* the effort required to keep everyone on the same page. What is relevant for each differentiated
  part or role.

  * Hire people to keep people on the same page like technical writing teams or systems engineers
    and then your org structure becomes more specialized, which has an adverse effect on keeping a
    company from having the same mission, as internal specializations become more exacting and org
    structures become more stove-piped.
  * the opaqueness of documentation. Even if you are consistent about keeping documentation up to
    date, the problem of knowing what each employee should know and should read is ill defined.
  * Why can't each asset be an opportunity (enhance generalization and exploration)
  * As a piece of the company, it is easier to write more than it is to delete or remove, as
    everything produced might still have value, and its very difficult to know what is _actually_
    relevant unless one is aware of the entire state of being of the company. This means
    that the artifacts of complexity and calcification naturally accrue.

# Where art thou oh superego?

* Companies take themselves too seriously

  * No one dies if a company fails. Companies are walking around in a dark forest of their own
    imaginations. It should be much easier for company capex and intellectual assets to feed the
    ecosystem if they don't make it then is currently the case. Unfortunately the 'corpse' of a
    company is pretty illegible, it takes a lot of effort to compare what one company is doing
    against another in order to see the pro and cons between the approaches of each particular
    capability.
  * Companies are supposed to make people's lives better, not people make companies lives
    better. Too often priorities are flipped when companies value their survival too strongly.
  * What is relevant to a company's short term and long term success is not often legible. In the
    short term, a company must know the intentions its supply chain, customer base, as well as
    employees in order to have a handle on what to focus on. In the long term, a company must
    find, form, and evolve a niche in the ecosystem of human needs in order to identify threats,
    understand allies, and support synergies.

* Companies don't take themselves seriously enough

  * Most improvements in quality of life require sustained attention across a long time, as well
    as an organized collection of differentiated expertise as well as low-enough stakes in order
    to finance multiple bets in the same space. A marketplace of companies is well suited to
    solving these constraints.
  * Instead of viewing companies as a jungle ecosystem, we should view them more as a
    microbiome. Characterized by a directed flow of energy (the needs and quality of life
    improvements of persons), as well as gene swapping. Companies should not be aimed at nation
    building, but healthy _local_ ecosystem building. Instead of defaulting to expansion and
    mergers when succeeding, companies should default to fractionate.
  * Companies are largely responsible for forming the ecological niche's that we operate
    within. They are the primary ecosystem builders of the mileau within which persons exist. As
    such, they shape preferences inasmuch as they find and respond to preferences.
