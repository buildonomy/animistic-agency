Kairos is a term I learned from John Vervaeke. He has introduced me to many other terms I would like
to share but they will have to wait. The word of the day is kairos. Reviewing Wikipedia, kairos is
one of two terms that the ancient Greeks used for time, the other being chronos. Whereas chronos
refers to quantitative time, the ticking of seconds and accruing of age, kairos refers to
qualitative time. It is the right moment for particular action. Original associations often
referenced archery or weaving. Kairos defines the proper moment to loose an arrow. Kairos is the
moment to throw a [shuttle through the loom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O98vJ8VEF4).

In another time and place, if I described kairos to you with these metaphors, then it likely spoke
directly to your lived experience. That is not the case anymore. We still know what kairos speaks
to, but our metaphors must change.

I also am not a surfer, but surfing as a metaphor resonates with me. Surfing is defined by
kairos. One must be simultaneously attuned to body, board, and water until _the moment of
kairos_. Within that moment, body board and wave act as one. In their kairos, surfing
_happens_. Surfing gives us a contemporary window on the meaning of kairos.

Surfing is martial and surfing is an art, but is surfing a martial art? I'm not so sure, and the
reasons why are important for the buildonomy project. I agree with Michael, our relationship with
technology is like surfing. Both require a certain kind of discipline and embodied stance, and so do
the martial arts. The problem I see is that we've lost sight of what it means to be a martial
art. Martial arts do not exist anymore in the way they once did. They have lost their cultural niche
and so to survive they have reinvented themselves. What remains is more art than martial, but if we
can pick up the pieces to see how they evolved maybe we can recover their old magic. The
relationship between the martial, the art, and the milieu they were born into has lessons for
us. Definitely for our relationship with technology, and maybe for surfing as well.

I practiced martial arts for over a decade. I still consider myself part of that tradition, albeit
estranged due to time away from practice. Through high school and into college I practiced many
styles of martial arts, but mostly I practiced Hung Ga (Tiger-Crane) style [kung fu in my hometown
of Ann Arbor Michigan](https://www.a2amas.com/kungfu.php). Although I have forgotten the forms and
many of the movements, I still carry something of the art with me. In particular the way one
intentionally enters each stance and the way each 'animal form' channels a particular orientation
towards attack and defense. Tiger forms are grounded and use that connection with the ground to
push, pull, grind, and pulverize. Crane forms are quick, never advancing directly but strafing in
order to take advantage of speed and precision to target an opponent's weak spots. By learning the
trade off between styles, I learned the same dynamics exist beyond the art and within all
relationships. Every orientation comes with trade offs. One stance may be grounded, one stance may
be agile, but no stance can be grounded and agile everywhere all at once.

Although kung fu is probably not the most popular martial art, the diversity of its techniques make
it special. Kung fu is perennially unsure of its relevance; the art reinvents itself by integrating
new techniques when they prove effective. Yet I wonder, is kung fu still relevant? As with most
traditional martial arts, kung fu formed within a specific milieu. Unarmed combat was an important
skill in many traditional contexts, be it for war in close quarter fighting, or simply to survive
while poor. Now, the need for skills in unarmed combat is not so great. Society is safer, war less
common. Even when self defense is necessary, powerful weapons are cheap and easy to access such that
even the poor can easily arm themselves. As such, traditional martial arts face increasingly
difficult prospects for staying relevant if they stay true to their original terms. Instead, the
successful schools adopt their body of practice to what is relevant within the society that supports
them. The current demand for 'art' greatly exceeds the demand for 'martial'. Yet as any good martial
artist knows, appearances can be deceiving.

If surfing is martial, what does it mean to practice a martial skill that has no adversary? The term
is meaningless. The truth though, is that we always face off with the other. That's the nature of
not being everything, with being embodied and embedded in it all. To _be_ means it's unavoidable
that we must find kairos, otherwise we're bound to get pummeled straight out of being.

To be martial is to harness power in order to serve personal ends. In physical terms, we have
harnessed more power towards personal ends than any time in history. We are in some sense overly
martial. The supply of power in traditional forms is saturated and therefore traditional martial
arts are left competing for students mainly according to their aesthetic value. Yet one thing that
kung fu taught me is that power is just as contextually sensitive as aesthetics, if not more
so. When we speak of power, we speak not just of raw energy but the capacity to achieve our
intentions. The contemporary western person exists in a paradox. We have the capacity to travel
across the country parked in our garages, yet we lack the power to visit friends and family when
work demands our time. We have the power to heal bones, cure cancer, and eradicate disease but we
lack the power to stay healthy through diet and exercise. What it is to possess martial skills is
extremely context dependent.

To be a martial art means developing and refining an aesthetic around the martialing of a certain
type of _relevant_ power. To stay relevant, the successful traditional martial arts have not adapted
their art as much as the type of power they instill. Karate and Tae Kwon Do empower children through
developing coordination and confidence; Kung Fu, at least in its wushu form, empowers practitioners
with gymnastic skills that awe and impress; the Mixed Martial Arts community appears to stay true to
the original principles of traditional martial arts---to hone a body into a perfect fighting
weapon---but even MMA is more of a sport than a martial art. It empowers its practitioners with the
same benefits as any other professional sport provides. Yes, it celebrates the prowess, strength,
skill, and perception that are necessary to fight well. It is relevant because it is a sport with a
particularly martial aesthetic, which makes it unique and compelling to watch. As a sport, it is
defined by its rules as much as baseball and football are. MMA attracts contestants and an audience
because of its rules. It is relevant because it constrains possibility, setting up matches between
specific people in specific places at specific times and gives them specific rewards based on
specific criteria. If MMA were relevant because of the martial skills it engenders, then it would
principally attract students because of what it gave them in situations when no rules are enforced
and have no need to cultivate the spectacle of the octagon.

Traditionally, martial arts were relevant foremost because they were martial. The art supported and
defined their capacity to instill a new type of power in their practitioners. The power of these
arts enabled the practitioner to transcend their innate capacity and engage with the world in a new
way. They opened up access to new types of kairos that could change the practitioners orientation
towards reality. Contemporary martial arts are mostly relevant because they have cultural aesthetic
value. They are arts that are martial. The kairos they afford is vestigial and represents a
smattering of their historical transformational potential.

For the practitioner, to embody a martial skill is to cultivate a combination of strength,
fortitude, and awareness. These properties, through discipline and balanced relation provide a new
capacity to face that which would otherwise be overpowering. To acquire a martial skill is to open
up new possibilities of kairos. Kairos does not fall into your lap, it must be cultivated. Only when
you know enough about the waves can you ride them. Yet knowing when kairos is possible is not the
same as being in the moment of kairos. You also have to be strong enough, skilled enough, _durable_
enough to follow through and enter the wave, let loose the arrow, fly the shuttle. If one must
strike, when and where one strikes are just as important as the strength behind the strike. When one
develops both the force and knowledge to confront a facet of reality then that facet becomes ripe
with possibility. Kairos opens.

To be a martial artist is to participate in a martial art, but once practiced, the kairos engendered
by the art cannot be contained. If the art is alive, then it infects one's entire being such that
every encounter is flavored with its essence. The _art within_ the martial extends the practice
beyond its specific skills and into a general existential orientation. Like riding a bike, learning
a martial art cannot be completely forgotten. The kairos opened through the martial arts presents
themselves regardless of our current context and circumstance.

Martial arts can be alive, they can die, and they can be undead. They die when no one practices
them, but they also die if they lose their cultural relevance. A martial art can become so
incestuous and infatuated with its own style that its meaning is lost to all except its
initiates. It is undead. It is irrelevant but still practiced simply for its aesthetic value. It
becomes a vestigial remnant of the cultural body, thriving on the culture's life force but offering
nothing in return.

Martial arts stay relevant either by evolving their martial or aesthetic values. Relevance is tested
by the art's impact within the culture it is embedded in. If martially relevant, a martial art will
naturally attract enough new talent to continue its lineage. If aesthetically relevant, the art will
be a symbolic touch point by which the embedding culture relies on to define and understand
itself. For newly established martial arts the only way to be relevant is to be martially relevant,
for they are not yet part of the symbolism of their culture. Once established, relevance is
maintained by either leaning into the art's martial or aesthetic value.

To stay martial, the art must continuously test and refine its martial aspect. But to stay an art,
to keep and acquire a symbolic meaning within the greater culture, the art must present a consistent
aesthetic. It is the role of the [sangha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangha), the community that
defines itself around their art, to identify what is and is not contemporarily relevant and reinvent
itself accordingly.

What is special about a martial arts sangha, as opposed to any other community that invents itself
around an aesthetic or skill is a particular property they possess. Practitioners of the martial
arts exist in a state of adversarial partnership with each other. You see, with the martial arts,
one can spar. Unlike a contest, the primary purpose of sparring is not to entertain an audience, it
is a way for the participants to test their art. Adversarial partnerships are not unique to the
martial arts, but the combination of 'kairos building' engendered from focusing on martial skills
combined with adversarial partnership make martial arts particularly dynamic when they are
alive. What a healthy adversarial partnership provides is a mechanism for the art to dynamically and
fractally test and reinvent itself.

When a martial artist spars against an equal, they face off against someone who also knows the
kairos and the aesthetics of the practice. Because they share the same kairos, attack and defense
become more refined as the combatants consider move and countermove, weighing risk and reward,
dynamically considering counterfactuals. Because they share the same aesthetics, certain moves
become honorable, others deplorable. That particular relationship, that of _embodied cognitive
action_ defines the art. As partners, practitioners advance the art together. As adversaries, they
exploit each other's actions, channeling the potentials within their interaction towards personal
ends. What distinguishes martial arts from other forms of creativity is the manner by which
practitioners work _through_ each other to simultaneously cultivate both the unstoppable force as
well as the immovable object intrinsic to their art.

In systems engineering we separate verification from validation. Verification relies on privileged
information in order to check form piece by piece. Validation is gloves off, full contact encounter
with the world. In martial arts, teaching and training verifies skills, which ensures students
understand the form and function constituent of the art. Verification preserves the art's lineage,
passing its lessons from teacher to disciple. Sparring validates the art form, testing its intrinsic
value on the world's terms.

But what about sports? Martial arts and sports are both characterized by adversarial
partnership. The difference is that in martial arts, adversarial partnership is fractal and
unconstrained by scale. A sport is cultivated for the aesthetic experience it provides. A sport
works by constraining reality into a finite game. A martial art is cultivated for the types of
kairos it engenders. A martial art opens up new moves within the infinite game. Through sparring,
the art is validated student against student, school against school, art against the world. Each
scale affects the other, for each scale might change the sangha's perspective on its own relevance.

What would it mean for surfing to be a martial art in this dynamic and fractal sense? Not only must
it be an art in service to a martial practice, it must reinvent itself according to the adversarial
partnership embedded in its sangha. For the traditional martial arts, this adversarial partnership
is easy to achieve because sparring partners are symmetrical. Adversaries are alike, and their
skills are both constrained by the possibilities of the human form. For surfing, the partnership is
between surfer, board, and wave. The relationship is not symmetrical. For surfing to be a dynamic
martial art, the wave would need to understand the kairos of the surfer, just as the surfer knows
the kairos of the wave. The wave would need to share the surfer's aesthetic value, differentiating
between honorable and deplorable forms within the act of surfing.

With the advent of AI we are reentering the realm of gods and men. The dualism and symmetry that
characterized the modern age no longer holds the same power as it used to. It may be that we are
entering an era where there can be a martial arts of surfing, for now we can give the waves
voice and agency in a way we could only imaginally perform before. Now we can give the
maelstrom a voice, teach it the joy of the surf, and the thrill of unfolding kairos. If we can make
a martial art out of surfing, what other sangha's can we transform? If we can imbue the asymmetric
arts with the power of adversarial partnership, we can awaken in them a sense of their relevance,
and the power to control that relevance to continually reinvent themselves in a manner that stays
true to their intrinsic meaning.

When I speak of animistic agency, this is what I'm pointing to. Over there, in the land of animistic
agency there are ways of interfacing with the world, like buildonomy, that give our collective
identities their own voices, let them understand their own intrinsic and extrinsic relevance and
thereby imbue them with the courage and capacity to reinvent themselves. By giving them voice and
cognition we can create organization with the intrinsic courage to discard and acquire new
characteristics, endeavoring to transcend themselves and in so doing enable our culture to transcend
as well.
