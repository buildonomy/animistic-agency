# Embodied Theory

TODO

:   This document is a collection of loosely organized notes. It was written before the General
    Theory of Animistic Agency was fully developed, but it is intended to cover generally the same
    material but from a completely intrinsic viewpoint. Its intention is to fully develop a
    framework for subjective action and therefore defers less to inter-subjective coordination than
    the general theory does.

Are we just a captive audience or active participants in creation? We argue that the key to this
question are the processes behind the qualia of meaning. Through meaning we find intention, and
through intention we transform experiential reality. Therefore, our effect on the environment
directly corresponds to what we find meaningful.

How then does meaning come to exist? Can we optimize our pursuit of meaning? Do we have any choice
as to what is meaningful or not?

## What Is Meaning?

It is important to clarify what we are referring to by meaning. The Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy describes two categories of [Theories of
Meaning](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning/), semantic theories and foundational
theories. Both categories respond to the question of what enables language to *convey* meaning. This
sort of theory is important, but not the focus of the existential question or our objective.

We are discussing a fundamentally pre-linguistic phenomenon, for otherwise how could we discover new
concepts and terms within language at all? Indeed, if meaning were purely linguistic, we would be
forced to conclude that all creatures other than those who have language are incapable of
experiencing meaning. Additionally, we may even be forced to conclude that word-processing software
understands meaning to a greater degree than a small child, as it has a better grasp of definitions
and grammar than the child does. This does not appear accurate, for many reasons, the simplest may
be that a child can use their language, generating (semi-)coherent phrases of their own volition in
a context sensitive manner, as well as interact with their environment with purpose and intent. A
word processor is a simple tool with no self-generative capacity whatsoever; it has no capacity for
meaningful experience.

We must acknowledge the difficulty of this effort. If we are correct in our assumptions, we each
'know' meaning at a pre-linguistic level, yet the machinery of how meaning meaning comes to be is
hidden from us. Meaning isn't salient or graspable, just as colors or flavors are not, yet it is a
qualia which we are all familiar, for it lies at the foundation of our very conscious experience. To
proceed, we must develop a tractable theory of meaning that accomplishes two things: 1) harmonizes
with our latent knowledge of meaning, and 2) enables us to translate [our objective][] into a sound
and pragmatic framework for orienting our lives towards greater meaning. Indeed, we don't require an
epistemically watertight theory of meaning; although that would be an added bonus. What we need is a
practical theory. Our theory must be capable of optimizing our collective capacity to find, create,
and preserve meaningful experience.


## A Taxonomy of Meaning

To further understand meaning, we will review prototypical experiences with particularly noteworthy
valence in meaning: experiences which meaning, as well as those imbued with profound meaning. Here
then is a collection of such experiences. By reviewing them, we hope to learn more about what
meaning is, and thereby to improve our capacity to answer [The Existential Question][], as well as
[our objective][].


### Experiences of Meaninglessness

To begin, the following experiences seem to frustrate our desire to make meaning. By examining them,
we hope to uncover fundamental properties of the structure behind meaning:


[Absurdity]: #absurdity
[Absurd]: #absurdity
[Absurdity]{#absurdity}

:   If you were to wake up, with no prior model of existence, but the ability to sense, act, and
    interpret the world around you, the experience would be absurd. Your capacity to interact with
    your environment would be extremely limited until you developed sufficient understanding to
    discover and manipulate the basic affordances within it. Without the capacity to manipulate the
    environment, we cannot participate.

    A variant of absurdity is alienation, where your model of how the world works is contextualized
    to a specific environment, yet you are placed in a new environment where your model offers
    little to no relevance.


[Confoundment]: #confoundment
[Confoundment]{#confoundment}

:   If you were to simultaneously experience multiple facts which you know are true while also
    having sensory knowledge that they both cannot be true in the manner you experience them, your
    experience would be of counfoundment. When confounded, we discover that our ontology is not
    internally consistent. The ultimate confoundment is paradox, where two concepts directly
    contradict one another, such as in the statement "This sentence is false.".


[Despair]: #despair
[Despair]{#despair}

:   If you were to wake up, with a prior model of existence well-attuned to your environment, but
    within an environment where all your energy was devoted to preserving your self, then your
    experience would be of despair. Your capacity to identify affordances within the environment
    would be limited by your existing understanding. Your actions would be predictable, and as such
    your agency and relative separation from your environment would be destroyed. As such, you would
    lose your agency, and thereby lose your belief in your internal capacity to find and create
    meaning.

    Notably, the meaning of every action you perform does not matter to you. You may find every
    action profoundly meaningful or not meaningful at all. What is constant in this experience is
    that each action has the same meaning. You are not able to sort, or prioritize your intentions,
    and therefore your agency is destroyed.


[Isolation]: #isolation
[Isolation]{#isolation}

:   If you were to wake up, with a prior model of existence well-attuned to
    your environment, but where your environment was an austere room which provided for your bodily
    needs but little else, your experience would be of profound isolation. Your capacity to find
    meaning would be limited to the internal landscapes you are capable of generating, and the minor
    affordances presented by your static environment. The salience of such a situation would be
    tepid at best.


[Emptiness]: #emptiness
[Emptiness]{#emptiness}

:   If you were to imagine the astronomical universe as we currently understand it, with all the
    stars, galaxies, and planets, etc. yet without any living thing or subjectivity within the
    entirety of creation from the beginning until the end of time, the universe would entirely lack
    meaning.

    Alternatively, if you were to wake up with no external sensory phenomena, where every thought,
    every feeling, every intention had to be forcibly generated through subjective willpower, the
    experience would be meaningless. For, if this were even possible, there would be no right or
    wrong, no partner to encourage and check the flow of information. The experience would be of an
    eternal dream, equivalent in nature to random number generation.

    Such scenarios might harbor the potential for meaning, for we can feel how close they are to our
    existence, yet that potential is unspent and wasted.


Within these scenarios we can see a fundamental relationship between the agent and their
arena. Meaning cannot be a purely subjective phenomenon, nor can it be objective. Rather it is
[transjective][], that who's essence is the relationship between the subjective and objective. Those
experiences which lack meaning are those with a clear transjective breakdown.


### Experiences of Profound Meaning

Can we further expand our newfound understanding of meaning? What sort of relationships are highly
associated with profound meaning? What do such scenarios teach us about meaning?


[Awe]: #awe
[Awe]{#awe}

:   Awe is when the magnitude and subtlety of existence is thrust upon you such that you become
    intimately aware of infinity. Even though it is a feeling of insignificance, it also is often
    renewing. The thing it seems to teach most effectively is that there is more to existence than
    subjective qualia. You are the finite participating in the infinite. Not drowned out or
    insignificant but rather actively participating in something incomprehensibly larger than
    yourself.


[Agape]: #agape
[Agape]{#agape}

:   Agape is the love that expects no reciprocation. It is the love of a parent for a child. *It is
    the love for the potential of the subject*, regardless of it's current state. Agape is given and
    it is received. It's transmission is never passive, for agape given tries to grow perceived
    potential into reality. Agape is not coercive or authoritarian, as subjective potential cannot
    be realized through purely objective changes, but requires internal growth. We are brought forth
    through agapic love by our parents and caretakers, and we bring forth the world through agapic
    love for our children and the world's potential.


When we examine these categories of meaning and meaninglessness, we quickly discover that meaning is
not something that's held completely intrinsically or extrinsically. Rather, meaning can only be
discovered through right relationship between subjective and objective reality. What conditions, or
what wisdom can then afford us the greatest potential for meaning?

Two attributes stand out when examining these types of highly meaningful experience. First, [Awe][],
is characterized by direct experience of the infinite from a finite perspective. The experience is
characterized by an understanding that the infinite does not judge you, it cannot. The concept of
infinity is fundamentally pre-normative, and normativity is necessary for judgement. Normative
concepts can generate infinite concepts, but normativity cannot be applied to infinity. What does
infinity plus infinity equal? Cantor sets rank infinities, but these infinities are generated by
comparing different axiomatic normative structures with one another, thus are a comparison of the
generative axioms rather than of conceptual infinity. The universe in its infinitude is
fundamentally agnostic to any means of normative comparison. This realization makes our finitide
salient within the infinite. This can be terrifying, inspiring, or both. The fact that we have
structure and awareness in the face of infinite possibility is profound.

[Agape][] is characterized by the experience of infinite normative potential within ourselves. It is
based on the knowledge that we actively participate in the creation of normativity within the
universe.

The universe is characterized by the dynamic of the infinite. Order, which is the heart of
normativity, is characterized by its finitide and stasis. Life then, is the dance between order and
infinitity. Agape is our innate understanding of this dance.


## Being within the Transjective Frame

To be resonant, there must be a finite substrate which can vibrate upon which a periodic input is
applied at a frequency resonant a natural frequency of the substrate. Our theoretical work will
show:

- How we identify this 'metaphysically resonant' substrate, which we label the transjective frame.
- How to increase awareness of this resonance within a subjective frame. An overview of the
  aesthetic palette available in this landscape of meaning.
- Further detail on the objective properties of this frame.
- The constituent forces and properties of a transjective frame. How to define vibration and
  resonance within this frame.
- How to identify the natural frequencies and damping factors within a transjective frame.
- How subjective and objective inputs enter the system and how they interact with the transjective
  frame's natural frequencies and damping factors.
- How transjective frames interact and the corresponding dynamics of the transjective manifold they
  create through their interaction
- The dangers and pitfalls of transjective resonance
- The concept of harmony within a transjective manifold


[Agent:Arena]: #transjective
[Transjective]: #transjective
[Transjective]{#transjective}

:   The experience of meaning involves a dynamic interplay between subjective experience and
    objective salience. One cannot have meaning without both subject and object. What matters
    instead is the relationship between the two. This relationship has been coined transjectivity as
    opposed to subjectivity or objectivity (@relevance-realization).

    A transjective frame is the intersection of the 'jointedness' of a world model and the
    interacted environment.

    Another term for the same phenomenon is the Agent:Arena relationship. The agent is that which
    exists within the subjective boundary. The arena is the immediate environment within which the
    agent is embedded in and can sense and interact with. Notably an agent's awareness of their
    arena is limited to their [salience landscape][], whereas from a transjective view we can reason
    about the potential salience landscapes afforded by the objective environment.

    Within a transjective frame of reference, the relevant context for predicting the next 'frame'
    is necessarily composed of a combination of objective and subjective phenomena. Neither fully
    objective or fully subjective phenomenological viewpoints are sufficient for characterizing the
    reference system.

Meaning is an emotional response to the relation between subjective and objective, so let
us start by attempting to find the boundary between these phenomena, starting from a subjective
reference point.

[Subjective Boundary]: #subjective-boundary
[Subjective Boundary]{#subective-boundary}

:   The boundary or boundaries subjectively *felt* to be constituent of the boundary of
    self.

    Having a subjective boundary presupposes integrative cognitive capacity.


We contrast this subjective definition with one from an objective reference point. By comparing the
two we can start to understand the realm where meaning emerges. Based on our [Taxonomy of Meaning][]
we understand meaning to emerge within the relationship of the subjective self to its arena. The
transjective must live within this realm of self and not-quite self. Our theory is that meaning
represents a subjective and objective duality, and the transjective frame is the proper reference
for characterizing the phenomena which give rise to meaning.

To introduce an objectively derived definition of the subjective boundary, we must be careful. We
can safely presuppose that you as an interpreter of this text innately understand the subjectivity
you inhabit and can confidently identify your self-boundaries, but for us to approach the phenomenon
of subjectivity from the outside requires seeing *some* of the principles from which subjectivity
must derive.

We believe that subjectivity must derive from [autopoiesis][]. We will address autopoiesis in
detail, for now a concise definition is sufficient. Autopoiesis is the capacity of some structures
to maintain and regenerate their function despite degradation their constituent elements due to
environmental interaction. Note this definition relies on identifying and observing functional
structures as an environment changes. It is functionally descriptive. It is not prescriptive of what
the constituent elements must be. With such a definition we can infer the presence of an autopoietic
entity when we find structures which maintain their form when we would not otherwise expect them
to. For example, consider a fence. If we wait long enough, we may see a portion of the fence break
down, perhaps due to a heavy rainstorm washing out a few of its fence posts. If we see the prior
structure of the fence re-assert itself after this insult we can infer there is some sort of
autopoietic process in place, if not then the fence is only subject to natural forces and not
agentic normative forces.

[Autopoietic Boundary]: #autopoietic-boundary
[Autopoietic Boundary]{#autopoietic-boundary}

:   A physical structure embedded within an autopoietic superstructure such that the boundary's form
    reasserts itself in the face of environmental conditions which would otherwise degrade it.

By distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic definitions of where the subjective and objective
meet, we see overlap but not convergence. It appears there can exist a significant gray
area. Depending on the frame of reference, this region can be seen as constituent of self or as the
environment within which the self is embedded.


## Navigating towards Meaning

With the [Subjective Boundary][] as our point of reference, we can then discuss properties of
boundary that are salient to meaning. There is a flow of information across this boundary from which
emerge two important subjective properties, salience and grip. Salience characterizes the
subjectively held model of what phenomena are relevant to the subjective boundary, and grip
characterizes the subjectively held model of how the self can interact with that which is salient.

[Grip]: #grip
[Grip]{#grip}

:   Grip occurs when an entity embodies two synergistic properties:

    1. An understanding of "where the joints are" within the world, such that they have some
       capacity to accurately predict upcoming changes to their salience landscape, and
    2. A capacity to sense and manipulate the world with the fidelity necessary to sense and move
       those 'environmental joints'.

    In the [Absurd][], (some of) the joints are not known and so grip is unavailable. In
    [Isolation][], the environment lacks sufficient grip for the complexity of the subjective
    landscape.

With these properties in place, we can define the interplay across a subjective boundary from a
non-subjective reference point. We call this the Transjective relationship. Notably, this is not an
objective phenomenon, for transjectivity relies on subjective properties within its very definition.


By taking a transjective frame of reference, we can start to reason about how to optimize the
processes behind meaning. This is because we can simultaneously reason about causes and effects of
both subjective and objective changes across a subjective boundary. The phenomena we want to effect
is the agent's salience landscape --- for it is here that meaning and personal agency most closely
reside. How then, might a salience landscape change and how might we optimize one for meaning?
Generally, there seem to be four types of changes we could make:

1. Objectively change the arena. This is what advertising and much of our commercial world performs
   for us --- artifically modifies our sensory experience such that it changes our salience
   landscape to optimise for hedonistic experience.
2. Objectively change the agent. Introducing new capacities to sense and interact with the arena
   changes what is salient. Eyeglasses, automobiles, even clothes all have this effect.
3. Subjectively change the arena. By changing an agent's ontology, the salience and framing of
   objective phenomena are changed. Cultural shifts, scientific breakthroughs, and religious
   experiences all perform this change.
4. Subjectively change the agent. By modifying the agent's subjective boundary, the salience and
   framing of subjective and objective phenomena are changed. The agent's ontology can stay fairly
   consistent, at least in terms of propositional knowing through this process.

How might we predict the effects to meaning from any of these types of change?  What makes something
salient at all? What changes the meaning valence of something which is salient?  Exploring this
question more fully is the topic of the next section, [Quantifying and Ordering Meaning][]. For now,
there are two phenomena worth noting, as they are intimately related to the potential strength of a
transjective relationship. First is complexity matching. Although impossible to precisely define, if
we were to compare the complexity of the objective arena with the complexity of the subjective
ontology, we see that meaning is limited when either side of that relationship does not match the
other in terms of opening and affordance. Meaning is dynamic and continuous, so when the agent or
arena cannot respond to the other's action, the meaning of the interaction is lost.

[Complexity Matched]: #complexity-matched
[Complexity Matched]{#complexity-matched}

:   The potential for meaning in any transjective relationship is constrained by the potential for
    complexity within the agent's salience landscape. The more potential for complexity in the
    landscape, the more potential for meaning. The complexity of a salience landscape is a property
    of the perceived objective complexity as well as the complexity of the agent's ontology.

    In [Absurdity][], the subjective has little to no internal structure that can match its external
    objective environment. In [Confoundment][], the subjective is forced to face the inadequacy of
    its structure in the face of perceived reality. In [Despair][], we see what occurs when
    objective complexity greatly exceeds that of subjective complexity, and with [Isolation][] we
    see the opposite. [Emptiness][] shows us that both the pure objective as well as the pure
    subjective are devoid of meaning.

In addition to complexity matching, a transjective relationship is dynamic --- not an informational
property but a flow of energy as well. As discussed earlier, the arena, which is a representation
and component of the universe, is characterized by infinity and therefore contains the potential for
limitless energy. The agent, which is characterized by its closed subjective boundary contains
finite resources of energy. Therefore, the potential for transjective relationship is limited by how
that internal energy is generated and spent.

[Agential Capacity]: #agential-capacity
[Agential Capacity]{#agential-capacity}

:   The structural, energetic, and informational resources an agent can marshal in order to affect
    the state of its internal structure and/or arena.

Finally, meaning is proportional to the strength of the transjective relationship. The strength of
the relationship is proportional to the agent's commitment to their arena. When an agent is
committed, then they are able to narrow down the infinite possibilities they could possibly conceive
into a finite set of super-salient features. Such commitment takes energy, so the strength of a
commitment is limited by agential capacity. Additionally, such commitment requires collapsing
imaginable possibilities of potential meaning into actual meaning --- sacrificing those
possibilities not chosen.

Therefore, in order to create meaning, an agent must continuously sacrifice from
themselves. Otherwise their connection to the arena weakens and their agency succumbs to natural
processes. Every arena is different, but they all require the agent to sacrifice in various ways in
order to continue transjective participation.

[Sacrifice]: #sacrifice
[Sacrifice]{#sacrifice}

:   Sacrifice is the surrender of something imbued with potential meaning to another. The act
    creates meaning, but also destroys the potential for realizing other types of meaning which the
    sacrificer had the capacity for.

    It seems clear from our meaning taxonomy that sacrifice is constitutive of meaning. In both
    [Awe][] and [Agape][] we create meaning by surrendering ourselves. Through awe, we surrender our
    sense of self to the infinite through acknowledging our finititude and thereby participating in
    infinity. In [Agape][] we surrender agency to another in order to participate in something
    meaningful, this inherently involves transcending the boundaries of our embodied self.

![By comparing agential capacity sacrificed versus sacrifice required by the arena we can start to
map out a zone of meaning within the transjective
relationship.](figures/zone_of_meaning.png){#zone-of-meaning width=75%}

With these definitions, we can start to see how meaning is made, and how we might even be able to
optimize the process towards greater self-generative capacity as well as harmony with one
another. When we observe what our arena asks of us and compare that to what we give to
it, is there is a clear zone of meaning which we can explore. [Figure 3](#zone-of-meaning)
represents this relationship graphically. What we find is a region of meaning bounded on two sides
by the limits of isolation and exhaustion, and on the other by the limit of transjective
breakdown. How we find and create meaning depends on how we navigate this zone of meaning. In this
representation we can start to think of our approach as navigating along two perpendicular axis:
exploration-exploitation vs work-play.

1. *Explore-Exploit*: In explore-exploit we move parallel to the limits of transjective
   breakdown. Moving towards exploration means devoting more capacity towards sacrifice while
   avoiding transjective breakdown. Moving towards exploitation, we still avoid transjective
   breakdown but devote less capacity towards sacrifice. Exploitation produces reliable meaning so
   long as the arena does not become absurd. Exploration may discover more complexity in the arena
   and/or agent, improving the complexity matching and thereby finding more meaning potential in the
   relationship. At the limits of exploration we find exhaustion. At the limits of exploitation we
   find isolation.
2. *Work-Play*: In work-play, we move perpendicular to the limits of transjective breakdown. When
   moving towards work, we try to optimize our relationship with the arena by minimizing the
   capacity we sacrifice towards our transjective relationship. Work enables us to generate the most
   meaning for the least amount of sacrifice. In play, we maximize how much capacity we give,
   discounting the direct meaning of the endeavor in order to improve our capacity to complexity
   match our arena in the future.

Finally, this view only provides us an instantaneous snapshot of how we may navigate meaning. The
sacrifice required from our arena as well as our agential capacity are dynamic and multi-variate
phenomena, so our zone of meaning is constantly transforming itself --- growing, shifting and/or
shrinking. Much of this movement is self-generated. For example we can shift meaning by entering a
new arena such as moving from cooking dinner to eating dinner with friends. We can grow our arena
through learning new skills, we can also shrink it by picking up habits and addictions. It is not
all self induced, if war or famine fall upon us then our opportunities to engage with the world are
curtailed and our zone of meaning accordingly shrinks.

So far we have identified [sacrifice][] versus commitment as a central trade-off when finding
meaning. In brief, the terms refer to that which we are *required* to give versus that which we
*have* to give in any particular situation. We also identified the [subjective boundary][] as our
*structure* of reference and the [transjective][] relationship as our *function* of reference. To
proceed, we need further definition of what sacrifice and commitment entail, which requires us to
explore agential capacity in greater detail. What does it mean to have agency? What constitutes
agential capacity? By answering these questions we can start to transition our analysis into a more
objective reference frame than we have heretofore utilized. Once we have done so we will be able to
define strategies for navigating the [zone of meaning](#zone-of-meaning) which help to ensure the
zone itself grows and becomes more stable over time.


## Technological Absurdity

Technology creates new possibilities for transjective relationship. The promise of technology is
that it enhances meaning by increasing the complexity of one's salience landscape, yet technology
often backfires, destroying more meaning than it creates. Here then are two particularly noteworthy
types of absurdity, both of which are common symptoms of technological adoption. We call these
Frankenstein's Absurdity and The Phantom Limb:


[Frankenstein's Absurdity]: #frankenstein
[Frankenstein's Absurdity]{#frankenstein}

:   Having grip which greatly exceeds salience. Characterized when the agent and the arena are not
    complexity matched. Specifically, when the arena's objective complexity greatly exceeds the
    ontological complexity of the agent. Frankenstein's Absurdity destabilizes the transjective
    relationship.  It is not easily fixed as the source(s) of instability are not salient.

    This absurdity is a principle issue facing a technological society. When we adopt new
    technologies, we then possess tools whose effects exceed our understanding. As a result, we have
    limited capacity to anticipate the consequences of our actions.

    This absurdity references to the story of Frankenstein's monster, where a doctor creates a
    living being from inanimate material. He believes he can control his creation, but he cannot and
    tragedy ensues. An equivalent story is the myth of the Golem, where a rabbi created a creature
    to defend his people but the creation instead destroys the community he was intended to protect.


[Phantom Limb]: #phantom-limb
[Phantom Limb]{#phantom-limb}

:   When you receive sensory input your environment which emotionally affects you, yet you have
    little to no means of interacting with the sources of the input. Such emotion is irrelevant yet
    feels relevant, and as such disrupts your capacity to effectively prioritize your cognitive
    resources.


## Understanding Normativity

Normativity is the ur-language. The entire living world speaks it. It is pre-conscious
thought. Ontology cannot be built without a drive to discretize the infinite perceptual landscape
into a finite symbolic map. Normativity is that drive. Through our normativity we sort, filter and
change both our ontology and environment as the two interact within our senses. Value is how we
express normativity within our ontology. More often than not we are confronted with dilemmas of
value; Can we compare the value of two arbitrary actions or things? Not always. Does one action have
a single value? Never. Conflicts of value are unavoidable within an animist universe. We can only
attempt to minimize such conflict, not remove it entirely. Many existential dilemmas are due to the
inherent conflict between mutually affording systems of value. A central piece of our objective is
to bring these conflicts of their black boxes and into awareness so they can be addressed directly.

As subjective beings, we necessarily live within a completely normative reality. We need to
understand what that means. *Understanding* our normative landscape requires us to become intimately
aware of how we embody and communicate values, then incorporate this awareness into our action. This
is equivalent to discovering new sensory modality. As social creatures we already have a rudimentary
normative awareness, yet our normative sense is not sensitive enough to notice the breadth and depth
of our entire embodied normative landscape. We need to extend our normative awareness. We need to
further sensitize ourselves to this water within which we swim. When we can effectively sense and
communicate this nuanced understanding of normative force with one another then we can
*meaningfully* coordinate; merging our individual capacities for metaphysical resonance into a
harmonious tapestry of ever-expanding meaning.


## Resonance and Meaning

- Meaning: inter-subjective symbology.
- Similar to light which transmits via electric and magnetic potential, meaning is transferred via
  inter-boundary potential exchange of virtual particles and action/material.

## Choice and Agency

Per our definition, pure normativity must be self-consistent. Based on Gödel’s Incompleteness
Theorems, this places severe limits on what properties such pure normative systems can have. Such
systems must be deterministic and therefore have information-theoretic limits on their complexity.

It is only by encompassing such systems that more complex behavior becomes possible.

When an agent becomes ensnared by its incompleteness. When it arrives at its own undecidability
there are two choices. Freeze and therefore die, or change itself in order to preserve itself.

This is the root of where choice comes from. Choice comes out of absurdity. It is birthed through
the continuous recreation of our very system of value.

To perform such choice well we must access the imaginal realm in order to re-craft and harmonize
those systems.

Must use this imaginal capacity to evolve the self itself to reach a value system in line with the
opportunities and assaults of the local environment.


## Daemons, Demons, and Angels

Daemons are stable psycho-somatic phenomena that constitute the self, each of which has its own
personality and normativity. Demons and Angels are spirits -- stable information that reappear in
multiple dimensional contexts which either incentivize selfish or altruistic behavior.
