[The Existential Question]{#the-existential-question}

:   Why am `I` `talking` with `you`\? Who am `I`\? How are we `talking`\? Who are `you`\?

Why am `I` `talking` with `you`? We don't mean to be rude, we think this is a very powerful
question. Who am `I`? How are we `talking`? Who are `you`? With these three words unbound to
context, the premise is more complicated than it first appears. We believe it to be *the*
existential question, and we have written this treatise to explore the idea and it's consequences.

Am `I` *we*? That's a complicated question. There's more than one author to this paper, yet we write
with one voice. *We* feels more comfortable, so that's how we'll refer to ourselves. It communicates
that the ideas within this paper do not spring from one mind, but could not exist without a large
collective of contributors, recognized or otherwise. Indeed, no `I` is truly self-contained, but
emerges from the relational web of a diverse cast of actors; these actors include the spectrum of
personalities within a single self as well as all those characters who developed the individual
intellectually and physically. From this perspective `I` and `we` are interchangeable.

Who are `you`? Are you part of us as well? We don't know yet, but within the context of this
treatise you could be. Through your contributions the idea is likely to evolve through multiple
editions. We are in dialogue with a `you`, but our envisaged `you` will not be found in this world,
instead you are part of our [imaginal][] realm. For us, `you` are a contributor who helps us
approach truth. `You` question our narrative, cross-check our propositions, show us where we jump to
conclusions, and let us know when we are too dull (too often). For *you* personally, we hope to
introduce new ideas, help question your [metaphysical][] assumptions, and help navigate your unique
personal context with a renewed sense of meaning.

Who are *you*? Which of your personalities is paying attention? Are you attending with your whole
being, or for work, for family, for who you want to be? Most of us compartmentalize our being
whether we realize it or not. We wear multiple hats, most often one at a time. Which `you` are
*you*?

How are we `talking`? Why are we `talking`? In this context, the why of our talk is fairly clear, it
is to explore an idea, that of Animistic Agency. What about how? We are not talking face to
face, but through the medium of the written word, so our "talk" appears asymmetrical. We believe it
is still talk though, just at a different speed than a typical conversation. Our talk becomes
dialogue, then dialectic in [dialogos][] as *you* process the idea, adapt it, revise it, and share
it. You participate by talking back through a communication medium and channel of your own. Talk
becomes transcendent when it transforms into [dialogos][]. Dialogos is characterized by
bi-directional communication where none of the participants in dialogue are in charge, yet the
conversation has coherent direction and flow that is sensed by the participants.

We are always in communication, although we are not always aware of with whom or why. Animistic
Agency helps to bring this diversity of unfolding conversations into awareness so that we can fully
participate in their meaning, enriching our shared arena through dialectic in dialogos.

A further note on communication, how and why it occurs is not always clear. There are a vast number
of communication mediums and an even vaster number of communication channels in each medium. Indeed,
as Marshall McLuhan famously said, "the medium is the message", and there is truth to that. Each
medium has its own normativity, and therefore its own message. As we will discuss later, the medium
of communication is best viewed as an active participant in dialogue due its effect on shaping
the resulting meaning.

So, here we are. We believe there is profound meaning in exploring the question *Why am I talking
with you*, where *I*, *talking*, and *you* are all bound to each unique context. This paper presents
our exploration of this question, and the lessons it has to teach about our relationships with our
selves, our technology, our society, and the world at large. We believe this silly question gently
confronts us with the metaphysical uncertainty inherent of existence. This question asks us to pay
attention to what is here right in front of us, one conversation at a time.

## Objective

We believe that existence can be continuously improved. Each moment holds the potential to be better
than the last. Our objective is to show you a framework through which this belief is better
realized. How you ask? The answer lies in the relationship between subjective and objective
reality. We will show you what lies at the heart of meaning itself, and we will then expand that
understanding into a tractable *method* for continuously optimizing the pursuit of meaning. By
continuously expanding our potential for realizing meaning, existence continuously improves both
subjectively and objectively.

This method must interface directly between subjectivity and objectivity, for that is where
existence occurs. The method is a *way* to navigate existence, not a destination. We are looking for
dynamic knowledge, a type of knowledge that changes us even as we change it. We are not looking for
absolute knowledge. The only absolute we believe in is change. We are looking for a more personal
knowledge. We ask "What am I right *now*?  Given what I am right now, what is most meaningful? Given
what is most meaningful, how do I best orient myself towards that meaning?"

[Objective]: #objective
[Our Objective]: #objective
[Objective]{#objective}
:   Find a *way* to continuously navigate and orient ourselves towards what is good and
    meaningful. We must be able to enter this way. We must be able to *apply* this way to our very
    being.

This *way*, our objective, is knowledge of a sort, but it is inherently open-ended. It is a means of
relating. There is *knowledge* we must *apply* to ourselves in order to enter this way. We must be
cautious, for any applied knowledge is technology, and technology is inherently
dangerous. Technology changes the world. It may change our internal world, our environment, or
both. Changing the world destabilizes the world. Once applied, we can never go back to how things
were. We must proceed cautiously, for we are all players in the [Infinite Game][], and the goal of
the Infinite Game is to continue the game. Finite games have winners and losers, beginnings and
endings. The Infinite Game contains them all, an infinity of finitudes, so long as the game
continues. Technology can end the game, for the game needs players, the players need the world, and
technology can change them both.


## Overview

Animistic Agency rests on three principle propositions and their corollaries:

1. All causal relationships map to an agential model representation. Agential models demonstrate a
   fractal property such that the constituent automata of one agent have agential representations in
   a regress that stretches to the infinite and infinitesimal limits of observable reality.
2. All dynamic semi-stable observable phenomena map to an autopoietic agential representation.
3. All phenomenology maps to representation within an *autopoietic* agential model.

We do not expect to plumb the depths of these propositions here. Our objective is to provide just
enough detail to defend our propositions as well as suggest their applicability towards [our
objective][]. It is the role of such applications, once implemented, to put the theory to the test.
