# Ecological Theory

TODO

:   The purpose of this document is to develop a suite of best practices for inferring and
    disrupting incentives within an ecology of agencies in order to better coordinate across some
    high level metric in that space, such as diversity, sustainability, happiness, growth, etc.

    Right now it is only a loosely organized collection of notes.

## Introduction

To role of Animistic Agency Ecological Theory is to define how to successfully infer the normative
order within an observed information substrate, as well as how to intervene within the substrate in
order to influence the normative order to exhibit desirable properties.


### Properties of multi-order (cultured) Information Substrates

- Subjectivity exists where a set of boundaries share a common normative order and cognitive engine
  'agent' lives in the symbolic universe made possible by that structure
- By acting according to meaning & value, agents interactions may form new semi-stable substrates,
  these emergent information mediums then may be colonized by new & more complex Æs, forming trophic
  levels onto the natural substrate that underpins the entire order.
- Æs manifest spirits when their normative order replicates & is broadly similar across many
  substrates, sharing properties & evolutionary behavior with no common cognitive engine
- As normative orders specialize, emergence occurs as different Æs specialize in different normative niches
- Such relationships can nest if/when our normative transfer creates an Æ out of the substrate
  itself. This way we get a fractal lattice of Æ/functions. This is the generalization of trophic
  orders.
- Complex and stable superorders manifest more and more stable information mediums, thereby
  expanding the available boundaries that agency may populate

## Finding Positive Sum Normative Relationships

- Sacrifice becomes positive sum when the dynamics within a shared information medium favor multiple
  Æ's receiving heterogeneous payoffs --- one's trash is another s treasure in a dynamic cycle. We
  want to analyze & cultivate such interaction. To culture populated information mediums with
  positive sum normative orders. To do so we need to translate between normative orders in different
  Æ's & find positive sum interactions normalized to an objective relationship we can measure on the
  information substrate.
- We want to then influence these positive sum normative transactions in order to design some
  desired characteristic into the substrate.

## Normative Harmony

Meaning and Value in Normative Dynamical Systems

- Meaning is a special normative term
- Normative terms in general speak to cost/benefit to a boundary condition.
- value's subject is intra-agential, it refers to benefit to one subjective agent.
- meaning's subject is inter-agential, it recognizes multiple distinct subjective agents and refers
  to cost/benefit between the set of recognized agents. Meaning always has value, but value does not
  necessarily have meaning.

    - Meaning speaks to something more than just preservation or quantification. It speaks to
      connection.
    - Meaning is potentially quantifiable in graph-theoretic measures: how much inter-normative
      system connectivity is provided, weighted by how much intra-normative system value is
      created. Function determines how much potential is unlocked from the inter-system synergies in
      value.
    - By *valuing* meaning, one internalizes meaning into one's normative order. One recognizes
      oneself as inherently defined by inter-subjective connections. One's sources of value resonate
      or dissonant with other autopoietic entities, and one's sources of value are inherently richer
      in a highly meaningful environment.

- Can have multiple instances of autopoiesis within the same shared substrate.

    - examples:

        - Culture exists upon humans + technology
        - microbiome propagates within human reproductive cycles
        - virus uses cell machinery

    - Such shared-substrate systems can be parasitic or synergistic depending the harmony between
      their normative orders.
    - Values harmonize when they are mutually reinforcing: does creating more value in one order
      create more value in the complimentary order or less?

    - understanding oneself as containing and constituent of multiple selves due to shared
      substrates changes ones default normative order. In this manner, certain types of meaning can
      be internalized as value.

    - When one combines this shared substrate understanding with ones imaginal capacity, one can
      access The Good.

      The Good is the broadest, most harmonious normative system possible. It is the imaginal system
      with the largest value potential and meaning potential in the universe.

      It achieves maximal value potential through maximizing meaning. By layering harmonious
      normative systems within the same shared substrate, each action maximizes value creation by
      maximizing the systems which receive value through that action.

    - When constrained by this imaginal construct, finding meaning is then a search function to
      realize The Good.

## Chemical Order Theory and Intention Modeling

- intention models become a new lens on ecosystem analysis, as they create a higher ordered
  representation upon which to perform structural anaysis such as [Chemical Order Theory on the
  complexity/stability of ecosystem-like commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08006). This presents
  the possibility for ententional ecosystem design in order to identify gaps in stable communities
  and evolve or integrate entities that can fill the necessary niches to induce their stability.
