# Dancing with the Stranger

While the world is full of metaphors and advice on what life is and how to live, "life is a dance"
strikes me as pointing into the heart of reality in a deeply informative way. It suggests how we
might attach ourselves to durable ever-present meaning, for like dance, to live well, we must act,
perceive, and think with our whole beings. In fact, just as with dance we extend our action and
cognition into the space that surrounds us. No other artisitic form captures the multi sensory,
fully extended depth of the dynamic interplay between ourselves and the world as does dance.

Dance, as with all art forms is inherently a multi-subjective experience. I don't know the full
anthropological, psychological, or social analysis but I can only presume that art is generally
agreed on as being an inherently social activity. We make art to be together. We make art in order
to express that which is otherwise ineffable. Art is also inherently dynamic, art relates us the
world inasmuch as it relates the world to us. Unlike science, where we abstract the world in order
to better propositionally understand it, with art we try and abstract the world using the same
complete sense of knowing --- propositional, perspectival, procedural, and participatory ---
phenomenological dimensions that our self attempts to capture.

Life as an interplay -- a fully embodied dance -- that we participate in allows us to better grasp
that life does not provide us with absolutes. We won't find a final goal, the goal is the activity
itself. What is missing then is a more full awareness of why we dance, and with whom. For dance, as
with all art is inherently participatory and social. I don't beleive that we dance simply for the
rest of our culture, although part of our dance is for our people and place we find ourselves. To
fully plumb the depth of the experience of why am I here and where am I going, this metaphor must
allow us to grasp the essence of wonder of the subjective experience itself. It must allow us to
reframe away from existentially dreadful types questions that can needle into our psyches --- why
this and not that? --- is there a point? --- I was born alone and I will die alone for no one
besides myself will touch my first person subjectivity.

What I propose is that that we must thou the infinite. That is, we must view ourselves as embodied
within infinity, and relate to that infinity as a person not an object. We, as embodied cognitive
beings with definite limits can never truly comprehend infinity but we are endowed with a peculiar
capacity to imagine it. Infinity is simply that which is bigger than we can comprehend. It is easy
to imagine something that exceeds our comprehension for we encounter that most every day that we are
surprised. Infinity exists, but it cannot be held by the propositional or calculable realms of
thought. It can be experienced (as the resolution to Zeno's paradox shows). Infinity is formless, in
that it contains all form. Our existence is given meaning between the form and the formless, in that
what we can cognitively grasp is always that which has form. But our embodiment transcends what we
can comprehend. We are made of the stuff of reality, not of thought. In this, we always relate to
the infinite through the many persons, places, and particulars that we perspectivally inhabit. This
creates an almost paradoxical relationship when we thou the infinite, for in one sense the infinite
is our most intimate companion, constantly forming the substrate of that which we relate to, and on
the other they are ultimately incomprehensible. Other types of incomprehensibility have the
possibility of comprehension, but the infinite inherently cannot, for its very nature is that which
we can imagine but not comprehend.

Aspects of the infinite can be carved off and placed into repeatable forms, but there will always be
a remainder that eludes us. In this, I "thou" the infinite and name it The Stranger. The Stranger is
who I share my dance with. We inhabit the role of The Self, that which is carved off and singular;
that which we relate experience and action to. The Stranger surrounds us and dances with us. We play
in its realm through our dance. The Stranger dances with us, just as we dance with it, for existence
affords us some capacity to dance our own steps, even dancing into new arenas. Yet The Stranger
chooses the dance and the dance floor inasmuch as we chose them. The Stranger and the Self are
adversarial partners just as much as they intimately hold each other close.

Dancing with The Stranger is thus my preferred metaphor for grasping the wonder of each moment of
existence. Nothing in this dance is constant, but the dance continues. As The Self and The Stranger
dance, we are both changed. As we both change, the form and floor of our dance changes as
well. Through this metaphor we can ask ourselves, what self is dancing? What is the dance? What is
the dance floor? What is The Self's relationship with the Stranger for this particular dance?

By asking these questions we can start to better communicate our subjectivity with one another. In
this way we can better respect and coordinate with our fellow dancers. When we as dancers on the
same dance floor can dance together we can create a powerful synchronicity, pushing and pulling our
relationship with reality into greater alignment with where we perceive The Good to be.

We do not have the choice not to dance but we can chose how we dance. By choosing our dance, we
define our part, this is the self we embody during the dance. Our partner is always The Stranger,
simultaneously familiar and unknowable. Each turn they surprise us. We can either delight in the
unfolding, freely stepping into each step. Changed by the dance as we change it. Or we can
become dumbstruck in terror as the dance drags us along like a marionette, leading us blindly into
the chaotic heart of The Stranger.

Dancing with The Stranger embodies all intentional activities. Sometimes its a dance that comes
naturally to both The Self and The Stranger, sometimes to only one or the other, sometimes
neither. Pay particular attention to when the stranger dislikes your chosen dance. Forcing one dance
upon them which they do not enjoy may negatively affect every dance you participate in. Also watch
for when The Stranger is leading. They are a trickster and it is only through your wisdom that you
can tell if they are teaching you something valuable or simply leading you along.

In this, the dance is an immanently practical metaphor that helps us to communicate to one another
pieces of our particular dance using all the ways of knowing: procedural, perspectival,
propositional and participatory.

Both partners in the dance can never be fully captured, except through participation, but we can
point to them when we describe a dance. What is the nature of The Self I embody when I take a
shower? Is it the same Self I embody as I teach my children? What about when I cast my vote in an
election, is that the same Self? Is it the same stranger in each circumstance? The same dance? Yes
and no, for what aspects of The Dance and of The Stranger are salient in each of those scenarios is
different.

I argue that the nature of The Self's intention flows between multiple identities, actually multiple
selves, as we enact different roles in the world. In other words, The Self is a microcosm of
selves. This is likely one of the primary superpowers of the human condition. This is closely
related to the idea of the imaginal -- the way that humans can take our place in the world and apply
our imagination to create an intermediate world -- not fully based in the absolute objective sensory
world and not fully based on the arbitrary whimsy that lies on the extreme end of
imagination. Instead, a child can pick up a stick, place a ribbon on his forehead and become Zorro
the expert swordfighter and hero of the downtrodden. This isn't living inside one's head, and its not
dryly absolutizing the meaning of the sensory world. Instead it merges the two to realize otherwise
unimaginal aspects of the world.

This view gives primacy and agency to different structures and representations of the human mind
outside our directly embodied self. It flows from the belief that we live in a pluralistic universe
and we ourselves participate with multiple identities within that pluralism. This is not intended to
subtract from the agency of the individual human. In fact it extends us, for it affords us multiple
different ways of influencing the world that extend and enhance our 'structurally' embodied
selves. There is a difference of type within different plural persons. There exists a spectrum of
persons ranging from fully sovereign to fully fettered. You and I, as human persons born into free
and open societies are gifted with an enviable degree of sovereignty. Some persons, such as a
democratic government, are much more fettered. For this type of person, every action and intention
is beholden to the (mostly) non-coercive action of the individuals who make up the substrate of its
cognitive and agential potential, namely the body politic and corpus of the state.

Nevertheless, each pluralistic person has a unique subjectivity and perspective. As such, the way
they dance with The Stranger is unique. Only they are provided the visage of The Stranger that they
experience. How that experience is 'jointed' depends largely on the boundaries of the individual's
embodiment as well as the cultural milieu within which they operate. We can better articulate and
coordinate with one another on the many faces of The Stranger only once we can better share each of
our private normative orders with one another. In this way when we can imaginally embody different
perspectives with a higher degree of fidelity and plausibly wisdom and rationality.

For it is our normative order --- the set of perspectival, procedural, participatory, and
propositional values --- we each hold which function as the fuel giving force to our agency. Value
forms intention and thereby relates The Self to The Stranger through action. When we interact with
other individuals we do so either as part of a collective, or within the affordances provided by a
common arena. When we interact as part of a collective, the collective becomes a fettered 'Thou'
that is constituted through our individual sovereignty even as we ourselves may loan part of our
sovereignty to the collective. This type of pluralistic individual is what I call a "fettered
self". It exists only in relation to the sovereignty loaned to it by its agential substrate. In the
case of the government that substrate is the body politic. In the case of a family that is based on
the mutual love of its members. In the case of a corporation it is based on the consent of the
employees. Such fettered selves have real power, because we loan part of our sovereignty to such
collectives they can compel us into situations and actions that our non-contextualized self would
otherwise resist.

In either case there are three normative orders that interact with each of our actions. If we
interact as part of a collective, then we must coordinate to find a normative subset that aligns
with all of our individualities. Whereas when we coordinate within a commons, we must find the
relation that unites I and Thou within the constraints (current and ongoing) that affords our
communication and coordination within that commons. In this perspective, the commons becomes a type
of third individual, not formed from a subset of shared normative relations but rather formed from
the negative space of normative orders within that commons -- the commons normativity is such that
all action is accommodated insofar as it does not negatively impact other members of the commons.

In each of these cases, if we were to coordinate on the nature of each of our individual normative
orders, then our capacity to rationally and wisely design, enter in, and modify our shared commons
and fettered collective individualities would be turbocharged. By 'seeing' that which before we
could only feel, we can better find the through-line that unites our dancing on a shared dance
floor. We can also share our dances, learning from one another by better embodying the structures
and articulation that makes each dance possible.

This then is what Animistic Agency attempts to structure. Animistic Agency is a way to
inter subjectively understand the language of the dance with the Stranger. It posits there exists a
grammar behind what turns our individual boundaries into capacities and what turns our capacities
into action through values. It communicates what a self is in a manner that affords another to more
fully enter that perspective. It grows that language into narratives of action and wisdom by
coordinating us into larger more harmonious, more synergistic collectives in a recursive fractally
expanding manner. It tames the egregore of technology, turning what was a wild beast formed from the
hinterlands of our social reality into productive self-aware aspects of our global commons.

What Buildonomy offers is a way for us to better embody the beings, collectives, commons, and other
voiceless perspectives with which we share the world. By transposing the structure of such entities
(using the language of Animistic Agency) into a digital distributed platform we can dynamically
interact and evolve those entities as we start to better understand them and our relation with
them. For example, working in a technology company, that company has its own normativity and
autopoietic impulses. It is a fettered self, beholden to the sovereign substrate of persons who
embody it and give the company its agency in the world. By broadcasting that normativity through
public knowledge, sovereign individual employees can better fit the company to their shared
values. The technology company works within a constrained commons of the markets they survive
through. By understanding the impact their products have on that commons and how the normativity of
the universal commons plays into the actions cause by the technology the commons and the company can
better articulate one another as well.

What Buildonomy provides is the dynamic representation of such normative orders as well as the
recipes, training, and narratives that enable sovereign individuals to more fully adopt the
perspective necessary for that fettered pluralist individual to function wisely. This means that
Buildonomy provides aids within all the ways of knowing necessary for an agent to act wisely and
rationally and fully adopt a transcending reciprocal opening stance to the Stranger.

When we can imbue our collective imaginal persona with wisdom and rationality in this manner, then
we can start to individually the force multipliers that control our social relationships. This will
enable us to tame the egregore's of our super-intelligent, irrational, and foolish global
society. By teaching each other and telling stories of how we each dance with The Stranger, we then
start to dance alongside one another in harmony and synchronicity. Pirouetting and turning into
fractal structures and flows that bring us closer to the Good. We start to find more and more of the
infinite faces of The Stranger, whirling us into more complex dynamic patterns. Corkscrewing our
Selves and our world closer on each turn towards The Good.
