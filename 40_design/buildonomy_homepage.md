Buildonomy realizes that each project has a life of its own. At its best, Product Lifecycle
Management software enables us to interact with our projects as designers, builders, caretakers,
scientists, constituents, and customers. As users of PLM software, its our job to define what that
life looks like in reality. To really give a project life, we must be able to dynamically coordinate
together from all the diverse perspectives that make a project successful. Buildonomy provides a
fundamental grammar that empowers your team to _dynamically_ create the interfaces, records, and
automation that provide the greatest value to who you are and what you are trying to
accomplish. With Buildonomy, you don't need separate platforms for your lean startup versus your
industry giant, as the capabilities of buildonomy stretch to fit the speed and agility of a small
team or the standards and precision of a mature and complex endeavor.

When you adopt Buildonomy, you don't need to worry about a costly and abrupt transition period. With
Buildonomy's advanced aggregation and synchronization capabilities, you can integrate
buildonomy-native data with your existing services in order to expose coherent task-driven
interfaces to your project.
