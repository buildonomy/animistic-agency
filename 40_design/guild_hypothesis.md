### The Open-Guild Hypothesis

1. belief-networks naturally generate small world network structures. The function of the dense
   networks within these networks will share family resemblances across many organizations. Each of
   these functions represents a meaningful specialty that requires a specific affectation and skill
   set to excel at. When specialists organize themselves inter-organizationally in a guild-structure
   using the paradigm of procedures-as-beliefs, then the following incentives are realized:

   1. By contributing both to the application of a specialty as well as the idea of the specialty,
      practitioners are incentivized to realize both pragmatic and epistemic value within their
      specialty. Their employer will reward them for a job that efficiently helps their coworkers,
      while their guild will reward them for exploring the adjacent possible space of the guild's
      specialization. The employer is the primary source for fungible rewards, and the guild is a
      source for renown and respect amongst a peer group. Access to this type of functional peer
      group is guaranteed source of non-fungible value for any practitioner that shares the
      affectation and/or skills of the specialty.

   1. When specialists contribute knowledge back to a guild structure, they help to build a 'guild
      brain', or a surprise-minimization engine that can act as a co-pilot for every practitioner. A
      guild brain ingests the anonymized results of procedural execution to create a model of
      expected outcomes within the guild specialty.

   1. Such a model and community has practical and self-actualizing benefits for the practitioner,
      as they have a means to dynamically educate and check themselves within the vagaries of day to
      day activities within their employment organization. By organizing in this manner,
      practitioners have the ability to collectively organize, and set a general framework for their
      compensation based on their guild-validated skills.

   1. Such a model and community has practical and self-actualizing benefits for the organization
      as well, as it enables them to cross-check the practitioner's work and easily uncover
      deception or other dishonorable behavior by comparing their results to the probabilistic
      distributions embodied by the guild brain. Organizations are liable to accept guild-based
      price negotiation because of the uncertainty reduction it brings to their workforce: 1) it is
      harder for practitioners to deceive the organization, 2) they essentially get two employees
      for the price of one, as each practitioner comes equipped with access to the guild brain, and
      3) they tap into a reliable source of non-fungible value for the practitioner. It is assumed
      that if the guild or employer uncovers evidence of deception or other punishable dishonorable
      practices, the practitioner's access to both the guild and the employer becomes extremely
      limited or removed outright.


## Differentiation



- Enables activation of multiple identities for an agent via matrixed identity: I am a member of the
  global systems engineer community and I am a member of buildonomy. The received value from either
  is non-fungible with one another, and if I deceive either community I lose access to both. Because
  I receive value from both, I optimize my payoff when I act in alignment with to the values of both
  identities. Therefore I channelize my identity into the intersection of both identities, which
  optimizes my value according to both identities. The more identities I can intersect into the same
  affordance landscape, the less and less rational it is for me to deceive any single one of them.

  - Skill community provides the templates, knowledge, and specialist brain that can assess how out
    of distribution my behavior is with the specialist community in aggregate.
  - Organization community provides access to monetary value by executing my skill in accordance
    with the organization's belief constellation.
