# What Will it Take to Sprout

To start buildonomy as anything more than disjointed ideas, it must take root in fertile soil and
find a real niche. To sprout, must stop growing off stored energy and generate value.

The value proposition for buildonomy comes down to:

- turning headless egregores into collective angels---intentional sources of collective agency
- squashing demonic egregores by naming them and representing them in our actions, thwarting their
  actions through our collective angels.
- Fitting knowledge acquisition into contextual, application-focused syntax, rather than abstracting
  knowledge from execution.
- optimizing action to fit multi-entity constraints
- working distributively and pluralistically such that no party has to commit to the same system
- Coordination without any shared equivalent value type
- Diversity and evolution of options, agency of-and-within the system.

Where is such a seed going to find fertile soil? Somewhere there is a multi-stakeholder distributed
problem space, characterized by hyper-objects, and very difficult optimization problems that only
surface when a series of small actions aggregate into large effects. There should also be clear
multi-dimensional value optimization in play. Not all action can be marginalized into a
uni-dimensional value type.

Most real-world problem spaces map to this description, but some map more clearly than others. One
core hyper-object to our existence is the production and consumption of food. It is a problem we all
share, and we all have multiple stakes We all have different values associated with the production
and consumption of food. What goes into our bodies according to multiple definitions of value
(cultural, taste, nutrition, price, convenience). And there are multiple forms of value associated
with the production of food (organic, fair trade, GMO, shelf-life, local). On top of the producers
at the human-scale, we have the organic substrate on which all food production is based. Each
species involved in this process has their own set of values which define their intrinsic wellness.

None of these players want to or can consolidate into a single unified normative
order. Nevertheless, their interactions manifest multiple scales of egregores---the aggregate of the
interactions of collective actions within their shared environment---these egregores act as agents
with intentional directed behavior.

- feeding families
- food producers
- bio-regions
- grocers
- restaurants

In addition, there is enough breadth in the landscape that enough monetary value can be extracted
that buildonomy can sustain itself and acquire employees. To start, an app that is amenable to
consumers, restaurants, and food producers that is able to better connect each to the other based on
non-monetary values while simplifying orders, analytics and tracing could be valuable. Chris Newman
often talks about how this sort of solidarity through differentiation is really what the regional,
sustainable food movement really needs.


Why?

- Their dynamics create egregores
- They are multi-scale (spacial and temporal)
- All are dealing with a very confusing environment where it's very hard to have good
  sense-making. Much of this comes down to very complex supply chains (biological, and
  economic). Not much of it comes down to the exactitude or bespoke-ness of the procedures
  themselves.
- They have a common set of substrates, amenable to MVP call, channel, bind semantic development.
- They are not looking to, or ever going to aggregate into a single entity, protocols over common
  homes. Nevertheless, they benefit from multi-scale coordination within angelic egregorical entity
  constraints.
- The value chain is (somewhat) amenable to transactional dynamics that don't (just) involve
  currency.
