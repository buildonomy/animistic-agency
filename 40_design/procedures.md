# Procedures are Inter-subjective

## Procedures, What an Amazing Idea


Procedures, checklists, and recipes---there's a lot going on here in such a 'simple' idea of stating
ingredients/supplies and steps to combine those elements into an anticipated outcome.

- multi-scale nature: temporal, spacial, type-specificity
- Procedures in this sense are open to red-lining and sub-execution
- recursion by reference
- generative
- identity/type
- focused on a specific task, but easily abstracted into generic lessons
- quasi-periodic: can represent a repeating task, but due to redlines, they organically evolve into
  it's relevant niche in a manner that's more flexible than code.
- They develop from intention to execution, such that they still have value if they are not
  complete. Both in terms of procedure and asRun execution.

## Lets Bring Procedures to Life

The standard reference frame in which we write and execute a procedure in is as an agent interacting
with objects. If we change that orientation to viewing a procedure as an inter-agent protocol, a
number of opportunities present themselves:


    call<channel, selector>
    call_answered
    bind<ids, binder, bound_id, bound_description?>
    recursion

- When you identify with multiple collectives, you can participate fractally in procedures
- Procedures vs code is the same difference as judicial vs executive. One is a law of the commons,
  one is a law of force. Procedures accept the executor has agency and accommodate redlines.

- to be a call-answered implies both parties have opened a channel on their medium of
  communication. This entails bi-directional interaction within the procedure.

  - This dynamic entails both sides of the interaction are informed, but in different manners, which
    is very useful in supply-chain (or privacy) interactions.

- They just become a wrapper for bi-directional inventory/data transaction messages
- But through aggregating these procedures and asRun (call_answered, bind) data within the various
  endpoints, then each endpoint acquires a markov blanket representation. Its open channels become its
  senses, the calls and calls answered its sensory inputs, its binds become its actions.
- With data like this, each party becomes an informed participant within the substrates they
  participate in, aware of the entities (individual and egregore) they participate within and with.
