### A Legible Model of Beliefs



All of this is offered through the protocol of a procedure. Procedures organize tasks into their
expected inputs, expected outputs, and the assembly roles, steps and checks that are expected to
transform the former into the latter. Unlike code, procedures offer a building block that can
scaffold creative as well as automatic work upon. Within a procedure, the actor is presumed to have
autonomy. They have the authority and responsibility to change the execution by enacting *redlines*,
or deviations from the script. It is through redlines that organizational flexibility, learning,
evolution, accountability and counterfactuals are developed. By enacting a procedure, a record of
that transaction accrues within the organizational memory. This becomes the source of priors and
beliefs that then become the shared model of organizational relevance. Procedures are not flat, they
are nested. Each one records a belief. The scale-free procedures determine the organization's
mission and they are then implemented by the roles, steps and checks that they define in their
body. It is through nesting this structure and acting within this structure that the full scale,
scope, and state of the organization's beliefs on what it is, where it is, and what it is
endeavoring to accomplish can be understood, tested, and enacted by the participants within its
confines.

## Procedures, What an Amazing Idea


Procedures, checklists, and recipes---there's a lot going on here in such a 'simple' idea of stating
ingredients/supplies and steps to combine those elements into an anticipated outcome.

- multi-scale nature: temporal, spacial, type-specificity
- Procedures in this sense are open to red-lining and sub-execution
- recursion by reference
- generative
- identity/type
- focused on a specific task, but easily abstracted into generic lessons
- quasi-periodic: can represent a repeating task, but due to redlines, they organically evolve into
  it's relevant niche in a manner that's more flexible than code.
- They develop from intention to execution, such that they still have value if they are not
  complete. Both in terms of procedure and asRun execution.

## Lets Bring Procedures to Life

The standard reference frame in which we write and execute a procedure in is as an agent interacting
with objects. If we change that orientation to viewing a procedure as an inter-agent protocol, a
number of opportunities present themselves:


    call<channel, selector>
    call_answered
    bind<ids, binder, bound_id, bound_description?>
    recursion

- When you identify with multiple collectives, you can participate fractally in procedures
- Procedures vs code is the same difference as judicial vs executive. One is a law of the commons,
  one is a law of force. Procedures accept the executor has agency and accommodate redlines.

- to be a call-answered implies both parties have opened a channel on their medium of
  communication. This entails bi-directional interaction within the procedure.

  - This dynamic entails both sides of the interaction are informed, but in different manners, which
    is very useful in supply-chain (or privacy) interactions.

- They just become a wrapper for bi-directional inventory/data transaction messages
- But through aggregating these procedures and asRun (call_answered, bind) data within the various
  endpoints, then each endpoint acquires a markov blanket representation. Its open channels become its
  senses, the calls and calls answered its sensory inputs, its binds become its actions.
- With data like this, each party becomes an informed participant within the substrates they
  participate in, aware of the entities (individual and egregore) they participate within and with.

## Calls and Binds

Each procedural step operates as a set of calls, binds and resulting transform type signatures.

How we can synthesize lifecycles, egregores, and bayesian mechanics within a call and bind mechanic.

## Apps don't solve problems

Why yet another screen interface is not going to solve collective sense-making. Instead, we need to
offload intention to something that has a different attention and perception than you, then dialogue
with that thing. The format of the dialogue probably should NOT be human language per-se, but
something that is differently legible. Procedures as intentions possibly? What if we had alternating
daily stand ups: one day where we each dialogue with our collective egregore impersonated, the other
where we dialogue together as the egregore's substrate?

## Technology and agency
New technology has two effects on agency. It changes the markov blankets of existing agents thereby
changing their consciousness, and/or it introduces new agents by changing the collective dynamics
within a substrate, introducing new egregores from those interactions.
