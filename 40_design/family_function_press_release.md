# Introducing the Family Function Buildonomy Community

## About this Document
Generated from [Almanac Template: Amazon's Internal Press
Release](https://almanac.io/docs/template-amazon-s-internal-press-release-52d69b6ef103c06437bb3a8140ca7c3f)

### What is an Internal Press Release?

There is an approach called “working backwards” that is widely used at Amazon, according to Ian
McAllister (\@ianmcall), General Manager at Amazon.

> "We work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it."

For new initiatives a product manager writes an internal press release announcing the finished
product, it is "centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external)
fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions", writes McAllister.

The PM keeps iterating on the press release until they’ve come up something really good.

> "Iterating on a press release is a lot quicker and less expensive than iterating on the product itself ."

### Advice

Keep it simple

3-4 sentences for most paragraphs

Don't make it into a spec (refer to this template next for a spec)

No geek-speak (imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her,
and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "geek-speak")

Rules of Engagement

Rule 1
:   must be stated at a future point in time where success has been achieved and realized. Press
    releases at “launch” are good, but a better one is sometime after launch, where true success can
    be discussed

Rule 2
:   discuss why it was important, often time to customers (or other key stakeholders). Discuss the
    accomplishments first in terms of why it is important to customers. How did the customer
    experience improve? Why do customer care? Then discuss other reasons why it was important and
    key goals

Rule 3
:   set an audacious and clear goal: Articulate clear measurable results including financial,
    operating, market share

Rule 4
:   outline the principles used that led to success. This is the trickiest, and more
    important. Outline the hard things accomplished, the important decisions, the design principles
    that led to success. Discuss the issues that had to be addressed to have success

Rule 5
:   Be passionate and have fun while doing it. To me, the most important rule of all.


# Family Function by Buildonomy


> *Title: Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand*

Family Function, a new community by Buildonomy, helps your whole family -- even you! -- grow skills

Buildonomy gives you back control of your most precious resource, your attention. Do you find it
difficult to pay attention to what you care about accomplishing? There's a lot that has to happen
between setting intentions and achieving them, what if you could easily coordinate all those
details? Buildonomy gives you and your community that power. The app helps you structure your time
so that your attention sticks not just on what your intentions are, but also on what you can control
in this moment. Family Function is one global community using Buildonomy to help each other navigate
the challenges of being a modern family. Family Function offers support, steps, and routines for you
and your family to overcome the big and small issues of happily living together.

> *Problem: Describe the problem your product solves.*

Even in the best of times, families are faced with a daunting set of challenges. Our lifestyles,
expectations, and support networks are evolving and often conflict with one another. It used to be
that you learned how to live "the good life" from how you were raised. But how often is that true
anymore? Would you even trust your parent's judgment on how to raise kids today? The needs and
expectations of living well today are much different than they were even ten years ago. Where can we
turn to for reliable family support? Many of us are spread thin, both in terms of our schedules and
the distance between us and our relatives. Too often as a parent we feel like we are taking on our
family's problems all by ourselves, leaving little time for healthy personal or family growth.

What if we could work together as a team? What if we had confidence that we are all doing our part?
When we face challenges together, we increase our potential for growth as individuals and as a
team. Buildonomy offers a set of tools to help ensure we can each increase our potential for
self-actualization through working together. When we work well together, we differentiate our roles
based on our personal needs and the group's needs. When we work well together, we balance and
support the group's priorities versus our own. Healthy groups create positive sum relationships
where both the group and the personal growth is possible, not one or the other.

> *Solution: Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.*

Family Function by Buildonomy helps us chart our own path through the maze of modern family
life. Buildonomy flips the script on what an app offers. Instead of pulling your attention away from
what's real and actionable, it helps you cut out the noise and focus on what you have the power to
control. Joining Family Function gives you access to a worldwide community of families facing
similar challenges to yourself. Together, we share what works and what doesn't when faced with both
the timeless and the contemporary problems of being and becoming strong families. By forming a
Buildonomy belief network within your household, then creating intentions, schedules, and rituals
based off the advice from the Family Function network, your family can chart your own course to
living in harmony. At Family Function you will find the routines, experts, and activities that help
give you and your family a renewed sense of agency in navigating life's challenges.

> "I found Family Function while looking for tips on how to pack for my family's first real trip
> since Leslie, my two year old daughter was born. We had to fly four hours and rent a car to visit
> my parents and I was worried about how Leslie would handle it. There's a ton of advice blogs out
> there, but what lead me to sign up for Family Function is I could really see how it could help me
> organize the trip with my husband, instead of both of us just trying to guess what the other one
> was taking care of. It worked like a charm! As an added bonus, after we arrived at my parent's
> house I happened to show it to my mom. Using Family Function, we found some great routines that
> have helped us stay much closer together even now, half a year since we visited them.
>
> I've even started to contribute back, for example I had some ideas on how to prepare for traveling
> with toddlers and I was able to contribute some redlines back to the traveling with toddlers trip
> routine. The author's loved my feedback and even included my updates! I like the feeling that I

> like how my feedback gives me a discount on next year's Family Function dues! Overall I think
