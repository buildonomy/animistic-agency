# Buildonomy Masterplan

This presents a strategic view of what Buildonomy intends to become. As such, it doesn't provide any
insight on tactical next steps, but it does present a destination, a direction, and suggest what
type of terrain we will encounter while blazing our path. The masterplan presents three company
phases, succeeding at each one is extremely difficult. Each one is intended to act as a flywheel
that jump-starts execution of the next phase. This masterplan view is inspired by the [Elon Musk
Company Formula](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html#part4), as explained by Tim Urban.

## The Company Formula

![the Elon Musk Company Formula](figures/Elon-company-formula-1.png){#elon-company-formula width=80%}

Starting Point
:   Organizations calcify, becoming less nimble as they find a cultural niche, and aren't often wise
    enough to reinvent themselves when conditions change. Therefore, our culture frequently falls
    into [multipolar traps](https://conversational-leadership.net/multipolar-trap/), where short
    term selfish interests take precident over collective survival. With organizations, multi-polar
    traps are further complicated because even if participants individually recognize their
    organization's culpability, their capacity to express the issue such that the organization acts
    appropriately is often severely limited.

Sustainable Business Model
:   An open core software business, similar to
    [WordPress](https://www.appsrhino.com/blogs/business-model-of-wordpress-complete-guide),
    [GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/stewardship/), and/or
    [HashiCorp](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4641311-hashicorp-a-solid-business-model-and-a-huge-opportunity)
    devoted to building an open core networked-procedures execution engine, and selling services and
    add-ons that help to customize the core product for different markets.

Company Innovation
:   A common set of tools for creating, relating, sharing and acting-upon beliefs.
    \
    Results in changes to how we create, learn, and coordinate. No more documentation
    cul-de-sacs. How you learn is how you execute. One medium that seamlessly conforms to an idea
    even as it transforms from nebulous concept to a tried and true algorithm.

Match that Ignites an Industry
:   Unifying creation, coordination, and execution results in reformulating what is possible
    through technology and collective action.

Industry Innovation
:   Organizational brains that help us teach, act, and communicate within a healthy ecosystem of
    collective and individual intelligences.

Goal
:   AGI is embedded within organizational structures that remain responsive to the needs of human
    and biological well-being.

Result of the Goal
:   An ecosystem of intelligences the accelerate positive-sum dynamics between all living beings.

## Phases One, Two, and Three of the Masterplan

### Phase One

[Introducing the Family Function Buildonomy Community][]

Rollout
:   1. Create a great open-source, local-first procedure engine and protocol
    1. Create a SASS Buildonomy hosted site
    1. Market an app-store Buildonomy offering on Apple, and Android app stores, as well as
       integration into popular community organizing platforms such as Discord servers, Slack,
       Facebook Groups.

Enables
:   1. [Finding 1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/)
    1. Income to support a small (1-3?) development team to work on next phase, principally based on
       sticky growth.
    1. More potential customers [know and care they have a
       problem](https://longform.asmartbear.com/problem/#self-aware-do-know-care-problem) and
       Buildonomy offers a solution.

### Phase Two

Rollout
:   1. Create first Buildonomy brain for exploring counterfactuals based on accrued organizational
       experience embedded in a procedure engine.
    1. Create a digital twin toolbox
    1. Marketplace. Create/find a suitable marketplace for services, add-ons and other
       customizations. Take a cut of transactions.

Enables
:   1. Expansion via viral growth, and more sticky growth.
    1. Start spanning B2B (digital-twin, etc customers) and extends B2C markets (home automation,
       food+nutrition).
    1. Growth to a 10-20 person company.
    1. Increased amount of animistic language starts popping up in discourse around role of people
       and organizations.

### Phase Three

Rollout
:   1. Create the guild mechanism that allows specialists to cross-contribute between their
       specialist 'guild' and their principle organization(s). Principle organizations adopt this
       mechanism because of the strong privacy controls it offers over their proprietary information
       as well as the additional value they accrue as they receive more skilled practitioners,
       access to a specialized 'guild brain' trained from across the guild's collective knowledge
       base, and a turbocharged sense of meaning and value from their practitioners as they see the
       scope of the impact they can make spread inter-organizationally and the attribution they can
       receive consequentially increase as well.
    1. Generative symbolism offers a mechanism that further integrates state of the art machine
       learning into the problem of organizational relevance. With generative symbolism, an
       organization can refactor their structure to better reflect their values and preserve their
       capabilities as much as possible. Similar to how thought and language inter-relate,
       generative symbolism works to uncover new belief structures that better represent and reflect
       the organization's intentions in the real world.

Enables
:   1. Cambrian explosion in types of organizations that start to be effective in the world
    1. Identity based normativity language (resonance, relevance, value-types) starts appearing in:
       1) AI and alignment organizations, 2) law and government including inter-government, 3)
       work-life balance discourse.
